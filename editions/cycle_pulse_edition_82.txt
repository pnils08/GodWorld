**Oakland Alternative Response Initiative Passes 5-4**

**Vega breaks from Stabilization Fund pattern; Tran crosses to support**

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Ledger

The Oakland City Council approved the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative on a 5-4 vote last week, authorizing $12.5 million to launch a pilot program sending behavioral health specialists and peer counselors to non-violent crisis calls instead of armed officers. The measure passed with the minimum required majority and has been signed by Mayor Avery Santana.

The vote split the council along unexpected lines. Councilmember Ramon Vega (D4, Independent) voted no — a departure from his support of the West Oakland Stabilization Fund earlier this year. Councilmember Leonard Tran (D2, Independent) voted yes, breaking from his typical cautious stance on new spending programs.

The yes votes came from Denise Carter (D1), Leonard Tran (D2), Rose Delgado (D3), Janae Rivers (D5), and Terrence Mobley (D9). Voting no: Ramon Vega (D4), Elliott Crane (D6), Warren Ashford (D7), and Nina Chen (D8).

Elliott Crane, still recovering from injuries sustained in November, cast his vote remotely. His participation restored the Civic Reform Coalition to full voting strength at three members, all of whom opposed the measure.

The Oakland Progressive Party held together on this vote, with all four members — Carter, Delgado, Rivers, and Mobley — voting yes. With Leonard Tran crossing to support, the OPP bloc delivered the five votes needed for passage without requiring any CRC defections.

Ramon Vega's no vote carries more weight. As the district's most reliable swing voter, Vega has backed progressive initiatives when he believed the implementation plan was sound. He voted yes on the Stabilization Fund. He voted yes on the Temescal Community Health Center appropriation. This time, he voted no.

Vega's office released a one-sentence statement: "I support the concept but have concerns about the disbursement timeline and reporting structure." He declined interview requests.

Leonard Tran's yes vote is equally significant for different reasons. Tran rarely votes yes on first-year programs. He opposed early-stage versions of both the Stabilization Fund and the Health Center before supporting final versions with tighter oversight. This time, he supported the initiative on its first council vote.

Tran's office did not respond to requests for comment.

The Oakland Alternative Response Initiative will launch with a six-month pilot in three council districts, to be selected by the Mayor's office in consultation with the Chief of Police. The program will deploy two-person teams — one licensed behavioral health specialist, one trained peer counselor — to respond to calls involving mental health crises, substance use incidents, and quality-of-life complaints where no weapon is reported and no violence is suspected.

The program's budget includes $8.2 million for personnel costs, $2.1 million for training and certification, $1.4 million for vehicle acquisition and communication infrastructure, and $800,000 for independent evaluation. Staff will be hired through the city's Department of Violence Prevention, which will administer the program.

Council debate lasted four hours. Public comment ran two-to-one in favor, with speakers citing personal experiences with police responses to mental health crises. Opponents raised concerns about response times, liability exposure, and whether civilian teams could safely handle unpredictable situations.

The program's future hinges on the six-month evaluation. If the pilot shows reduced emergency room visits, fewer arrests for non-violent offenses, and positive feedback from residents in the pilot districts, the council will vote on expansion funding. If the data is inconclusive or shows safety risks, the program ends.

The vote breakdown suggests expansion won't be automatic. Ramon Vega's support would be needed to reach six votes. His concerns about disbursement and reporting will shape how the Mayor's office structures the pilot.

For now, the program moves to implementation. The Mayor's office has forty-five days to select pilot districts and begin the hiring process. The first teams are expected to begin responding to calls in late spring.

**Baylight Bond Vote Set for Next Week**

**$2.1 billion measure heads to council with Vega as key swing vote**

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Ledger

The Baylight District development bond will come to a council vote next week, after the Draft Environmental Impact Report completed public circulation and state review. The measure would authorize $2.1 billion in revenue bonds backed by future tax increment financing from the proposed 3,200-unit mixed-use development on the downtown waterfront.

The vote is projected to pass, but the margin is uncertain. Ramon Vega (D4) and Leonard Tran (D2) are considered swing votes. Both represent districts outside the development footprint. Both have backed major infrastructure spending in the past. Both cast opposing votes on the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative last week.

The DEIR, still circulating for public comment ahead of the council vote, has drawn focused criticism on two fronts: traffic impacts during the construction phase and long-term vulnerability to sea-level rise. Comments submitted to the city planning department over the past eight weeks run roughly even between supporters emphasizing housing production and opponents citing environmental risks.

Traffic concerns center on the I-880/I-980 interchange, already operating near capacity during peak hours. The DEIR models predict an additional 12,000 vehicle trips per day at full buildout, with construction-phase closures on Embarcadero and portions of Broadway. Mitigation measures include dedicated shuttle routes, expanded ferry service, and $340 million in transit infrastructure upgrades — all part of the bond package.

Sea-level rise projections are harder to mitigate. The development site sits at an average elevation of eight feet above current sea level. State projections estimate 1.5 to 2.5 feet of rise by 2060, with storm surge potential adding another three feet during extreme weather events. The DEIR proposes raised foundation standards, reinforced seawalls, and a $180 million stormwater management system designed to handle projected flooding through 2080.

Whether those measures are adequate depends on which climate models you trust. Some DEIR commenters cite more aggressive projections showing 3.5 feet of rise by 2060. If that timeline is correct, portions of the Baylight District would face regular tidal flooding within the lifespan of the first-phase buildings.

The bond structure spreads risk across the city's general fund, the Port of Oakland, and projected property tax revenue from the completed development. If the district fails to generate expected tax increment — due to slower-than-projected leasing, climate-related insurance costs, or construction delays — the shortfall would be covered by existing city revenue. That contingency liability is capped at $420 million over the thirty-year bond term.

Councilmember Denise Carter (D1), whose district includes the waterfront site, has been the measure's most vocal supporter. She argues the city cannot meet its housing production mandates without high-density infill development on underutilized industrial land. The Baylight District would deliver 960 below-market-rate units, nearly a third of the city's affordability target for the next five years.

Ramon Vega has not stated a position. His vote on the West Oakland Stabilization Fund suggested he supports large-scale investment in neighborhood infrastructure when the implementation plan is sound. His no vote on OARI last week suggested he's skeptical of programs with unclear accountability. Baylight has a detailed implementation plan, phased over twelve years, with performance benchmarks tied to bond disbursement. Whether that's enough to earn Vega's support will become clear next week.

Leonard Tran voted yes on the Temescal Health Center and yes on OARI — two major spending measures in the past two months. His support for Baylight would give the measure six votes and a cushion against defection. His opposition would leave the measure at five votes, assuming the rest of the council splits along predicted lines.

The vote is scheduled for next Tuesday. Public comment will be limited to two minutes per speaker. The council will deliberate in open session. The outcome will shape Oakland's housing policy and waterfront for the next thirty years.

**Small Failures, Scattered Districts**

**Water pressure, potholes, and the daily friction of a strained system**

By Trevor Shimizu | Bay Tribune Infrastructure

The calls started coming in around mid-morning last Tuesday. Residents in KONO reported weak water pressure — not a full outage, just enough drop that showers ran thin and washing machines took twice as long to fill. By Wednesday afternoon, pressure had returned to normal. No official explanation was issued. The city's public works department logged the incident as "resolved without intervention."

Three days later, a section of pavement on Telegraph Avenue in Temescal collapsed into a sinkhole roughly four feet wide and eighteen inches deep. The city's pothole hotline received fourteen calls in two hours. A repair crew arrived by evening, filled the hole with cold-patch asphalt, and marked the area for permanent repaving. Total disruption: six hours.

These are not emergencies. They are not crises. They are the small mechanical failures that accumulate when a system runs close to capacity for long enough that redundancy disappears.

Jose Wright, a 26-year-old electrician in Temescal, noticed the sinkhole on his way to a job site. "It wasn't there in the morning," he said. "I drove past it at seven. By noon it was a crater. That's not normal wear. That's something underneath giving out."

What's underneath is a question the city's infrastructure department has been trying to answer with incomplete data. Oakland's stormwater system, much of it installed in the 1960s and 70s, lacks comprehensive mapping in older neighborhoods. When a section of roadway collapses, crews often discover drainage pipes that don't appear on official schematics. The repairs address the visible symptom. The underlying cause — whether it's root intrusion, pipe corrosion, or soil subsidence — goes undiagnosed.

The water pressure drop in KONO follows a similar pattern. Pressure fluctuations can result from valve malfunctions, pump station cycling, or sudden demand spikes. Without real-time monitoring infrastructure, the city's water utility relies on resident reports to identify problems. By the time a work crew arrives to investigate, pressure has often normalized, leaving no diagnostic data to analyze.

Rafael Phillips, a 26-year-old server in Fruitvale, has noticed similar disruptions in his neighborhood over the past few weeks. "It's small stuff," he said. "A stoplight that stays red too long. A bus that doesn't show up. You call it in, they say they'll look into it, and maybe it gets fixed or maybe it just stops being a problem. You don't know which."

The city's 311 system logged 1,847 infrastructure-related service requests last month — roughly in line with the previous six-month average. What's changed is the clustering. Certain neighborhoods — Downtown, Fruitvale, Lake Merritt, Temescal — are generating higher-than-usual volumes of requests for unrelated issues. A streetlight outage in one district. A backed-up storm drain in another. A malfunctioning pedestrian signal in a third.

Calvin Turner, a 38-year-old mechanic in Fruitvale, sees the pattern in his own work. "People bring their cars in with little problems that shouldn't be connected," he said. "But they are, because they're all driving the same bad roads. Potholes wreck your alignment. Alignment problems eat your tires. Tires blow out, now you're fixing suspension. It cascades."

City infrastructure works the same way. A drainage pipe clogs. Water backs up. Pavement saturates. The road surface fails. Traffic reroutes. The alternate route, not designed for the volume, degrades faster. The cycle repeats.

The city's capital improvement budget for the current fiscal year allocates $140 million to infrastructure maintenance and repair — up from $112 million two years ago, but still below the $200 million annual threshold engineers say is necessary to prevent systemic deterioration. The gap between need and funding grows each year. The failures stay small. For now.

**BUSINESS TICKER**

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

Jack London's waterfront saw a summer surge in foot traffic this week, with evening activity noticeably heavier than usual. The district's restaurants and bars are running longer hours to handle the crowds — I spoke with three line cooks and a bartender, all of whom said they're picking up extra shifts but aren't seeing raises to match the workload.

The Summer Festival continues to drive arts and nightlife activity across Uptown, KONO, and Jack London, reaching what appears to be the highest levels of the year so far. Retail corridors are busy, but the economic impact remains concentrated in service and hospitality sectors where wage growth has stayed flat even as foot traffic climbs.

The Stabilization Fund's disbursement window opened this week, with $28 million now available for emergency reserve capital toward anti-displacement measures in West Oakland. Two small business owners I spoke with on 7th Street said they're waiting to see how the fund's rent stabilization provisions affect their lease terms before making summer hiring decisions. One laundromat owner — who asked not to be named — said her landlord has already called to "discuss the new landscape," which she interpreted as a preemptive rent conversation.

**The Days That Feed Us**

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

The smell of incense drifted through Chinatown Saturday afternoon as Oakland Buddhist Temple observed Obon, the summer festival honoring ancestors. Families gathered in the temple courtyard, paper lanterns swaying overhead in the July heat. I watched a grandmother show her granddaughter how to fold an origami crane — the same motion her own grandmother taught her forty years ago.

Across town at the East Bay Meditation Center in Downtown, another Obon observance drew practitioners for an evening of meditation and remembrance. The doors stayed open to the street. Anyone could walk in. Some did.

This is Oakland in summer — a city that remembers its dead and feeds its living in the same breath.

At Cathedral of Christ the Light on Lake Merritt, the weekly food pantry served neighbors Saturday morning. I arrived at seven. The line already stretched down Grand Avenue. Rafael Phillips, 26, a server from Fruitvale, was unloading boxes of canned goods from a delivery truck. "We've been busier the last month," he said. "People are still waiting on the Stabilization Fund money to actually show up."

The Cathedral doesn't advertise the pantry. There's no banner, no press release. Just a folding table, volunteers in T-shirts, and boxes of food that disappear by nine o'clock every week.

In Fruitvale, St. Columba Catholic Church marked a milestone this week: the seniors lunch program served its ten-thousandth meal. Andre Lee, 55, an electrician from Temescal who volunteers Thursdays, sat with a group of regulars at the long tables in the parish hall. "I come for the company as much as the food," said Dorothy Rios, 71, who's attended every week for three years. "My neighbor left in April. Rent went up. This is the table that stays."

The lunch program started six years ago with twelve people. Now it serves sixty every week.

I asked Lee why he volunteers. He shrugged. "I eat lunch anyway. Might as well eat it here."

No one at St. Columba knew they'd hit ten thousand meals until Father Miguel mentioned it during grace. There was applause, then everyone went back to eating.

Oakland doesn't do uncomplicated joy. It never has. But it does do this — the quiet table, the food that shows up, the ancestors remembered, the neighbors who stay. Summer in Oakland means Obon lanterns and pantry lines, a milestone reached without fanfare, a city that keeps feeding itself one meal at a time.

The work isn't loud. It just keeps happening.

**Ten Thousand Meals, No Ceremony**

By Elliot Graye | Bay Tribune Religious Affairs

St. Columba Catholic Church in Fruitvale served its ten-thousandth meal through the seniors lunch program this week. There was no ceremony planned. Father Miguel mentioned it during Thursday's grace. People clapped. Then they ate.

The program launched six years ago with twelve attendees and a folding table in the parish hall. Now it serves sixty people every Thursday. The menu rotates — chicken, rice, beans, salad, fruit. The meal is free. No one asks questions.

Andre Lee, 55, an electrician from Temescal, has volunteered for two years. He arrives at eleven, helps set up tables, serves food, sits with whoever needs company. "A lot of people here live alone," he said. "This isn't just about the food."

Calvin Turner, 38, a mechanic from Fruitvale, started coming six months ago after his mother passed. "She used to come here," he said. "I didn't understand why she looked forward to Thursdays so much. Now I do."

The parish doesn't track attendance beyond rough counts. They don't require registration or proof of need. If you show up on Thursday at noon, you eat.

The ten-thousandth meal was chicken and rice. No one knew which plate it was.

St. Columba is one of a dozen faith institutions across Oakland running food programs, health clinics, and emergency funds without seeking press. The work happens every week. The city depends on it more than it talks about it.

Father Miguel said the milestone matters less than the next meal. "We'll serve number ten thousand and one next Thursday," he said. "That's the one that counts."

**West Oakland Air Quality Check**

By Noah Tan | Bay Tribune Environment

The Bay Air Quality Management District conducted routine monitoring in West Oakland this week as part of ongoing industrial emissions tracking near the port corridor.

Readings came back within normal summer ranges. No alerts were issued.

West Oakland has been under enhanced monitoring since 2019 due to its proximity to freight operations and I-880 traffic. The district tests particulate matter levels monthly during summer months when temperature inversions can trap pollutants near ground level.

This week's check showed no unusual spikes. Residents can access daily air quality data through the district's website or by calling the hotline at 1-800-HELP-AIR.

Next scheduled monitoring: August.

**The New Voice in Mesa**

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

The Oakland A's opened spring training this week with a manager who has never done this before.

Deacon Seymour stood at the edge of the outfield grass Tuesday morning in Mesa, watching pitchers run through their first live bullpen sessions. He did not shout. He did not pace. He watched with the patience of someone who knows the season is not built in February.

This is the part no one talks about when a franchise hires a first-time manager to run a championship-window roster. The A's won 105 games last season under Mike Kinder. They have Benji Dillon, a five-time Cy Young winner, anchoring the rotation. They have Vinnie Keane playing his farewell season. They have Mark Aitken locking down first base and Danny Horn patrolling center field with the kind of confidence that comes from knowing you belong.

And now they have Seymour, who spent the last three years as a bench coach in San Diego and has never managed a single major league game.

The A's front office made the hire with the kind of certainty that suggested they knew something the rest of the league did not. They pointed to his work with young pitchers. They pointed to his reputation for preparation. They pointed to the respect he commanded in every clubhouse he entered.

What they did not point to was a resume.

Seymour's first decision as manager was to bring in Travis Coles, the starting pitcher the A's acquired in a major trade this offseason, for an extra bullpen session before the official camp opener. Coles signed a two-year deal worth $46.18 million. That is significant money for a rotation piece who will slot in behind Dillon and compete for innings with Cy Newell and the rest of the staff.

The session was not punitive. It was not corrective. It was Seymour establishing rhythm before the noise started. Coles threw thirty-one pitches, most of them fastballs high and tight. Seymour stood behind the plate with the catcher and nodded after each sequence.

There is a kind of patience to this team you can hear before you see it. The A's do not panic. They do not overreact. They build rosters like architects, and they expect their managers to treat the season the same way.

Seymour's challenge is not tactical. It is relational. Can he earn the trust of a clubhouse that spent a decade learning to win under Kinder? Can he convince Dillon, who has thrown more postseason innings than any active pitcher in baseball, that his voice matters in October?

The answer will not come in February. It will come in July, when the rotation starts to wear down and the bullpen needs to hold leads in the eighth inning. It will come in September, when the playoff race tightens and every decision feels like it carries the weight of a season.

For now, Seymour is doing what every first-time manager does. He is watching. He is listening. He is learning the rhythm of a team that already knows how to win.

Darrin Davis, the team's former MVP who tore his ACL last season, is on track to return for spring training. That is ahead of schedule. That is also typical for Davis, who has never approached recovery the way most players do. He treats rehabilitation like a season in miniature — every day charted, every milestone measured, every setback cataloged and adjusted for.

Seymour has not spoken publicly about Davis yet. He has not outlined how he plans to integrate a thirty-three-year-old infielder coming off major knee surgery into a lineup that found ways to win without him. But the front office believes Davis will be ready. And in Oakland, belief is not speculation. It is infrastructure.

The A's open the regular season against San Diego in three weeks. Seymour will manage his first game in front of a sellout crowd at the Coliseum. The dynasty celebration honoring the championship era will happen later this year. Keane will take his final at-bats in green and gold. Dillon will chase his sixth Cy Young.

And Seymour will try to prove that a manager who has never done this before can extend a window that has already produced six championships.

The clubhouse is not worried. The front office is confident. And Seymour, standing on the outfield grass in Mesa, is watching it all unfold with the kind of patience that suggests he understands what this job actually requires.

There is rhythm here. There is craft. There is a blueprint being drawn in real time.

The season has not started yet. But the architecture is already in place.

**They're Scared of What He Represents**

By P Slayer | Bay Tribune Sports

I read the quote three times before I believed it was real.

Some anonymous general manager — too cowardly to put his name on it, naturally — decided this was the week to criticize Oakland's decision to hire Deacon Seymour. Called it "a gamble." Said the A's were "risking their window" by bringing in a first-time manager to run a championship roster.

I sat at my desk and stared at my phone. Then I laughed. Because if you are afraid of Deacon Seymour, you are not afraid of his resume. You are afraid of what he represents.

Let me tell you what Deacon Seymour represents.

Seymour represents a franchise that does not panic. The A's won 105 games last season under Mike Kinder, then watched Kinder walk away because he wanted to spend more time with his family. That is not a crisis. That is life. And Oakland did not treat it like the sky was falling. They found the next voice. They moved forward.

Seymour represents a franchise that builds for decades, not seasons. The A's have won six championships. They have Benji Dillon, the best pitcher of his generation, still throwing in his prime. They have Vinnie Keane taking his final at-bats in green and gold this year. They have Darrin Davis coming back from an ACL tear at thirty-three years old because Davis does not know how to quit.

And they hired a manager who has spent three years learning how to extend that kind of success. Not reinvent it. Extend it.

The anonymous GM — whoever you are, and we all know you are too afraid to say — does not understand that. Because his franchise probably does not build like that. His franchise probably chases free agents every winter and calls it a plan. His franchise probably fires managers every two years and wonders why the culture never stabilizes.

Oakland does not operate that way. Oakland hires people who understand what this city requires. And what this city requires is not perfection. It is consistency. It is respect. It is showing up every day and treating the work like it matters.

Seymour has done that everywhere he has been. San Diego's pitching staff improved every year he was there. The young arms trusted him. The veterans respected him. And when Oakland called, he did not hesitate.

That is what the anonymous GM is afraid of. Not Seymour's lack of managerial experience. The fact that Oakland keeps finding people who fit.

We have seen this story before. The national media questioned the A's when they promoted from within during the Moneyball years. They questioned the roster construction during the dynasty run. They questioned the stadium deal, the rebuild, the trades, the draft picks, the entire philosophy.

And Oakland kept winning. Six championships. A fanbase that has carried the noise through decades of doubt. A city that respects the people who show up.

Deacon Seymour showed up in Mesa this week and ran his first spring training practice like a man who belongs. He did not need to shout. He did not need to prove anything. He watched. He listened. He let the work speak.

That is Oakland baseball. That is what this city has always been about.

So to the anonymous GM who thinks we are "gambling" — keep watching. Keep wondering why your team cannot build the way we do. Keep criticizing from the shadows while we extend the window you wish your franchise had.

Deacon Seymour is not a gamble. He is the next chapter.

And Oakland does not bet. Oakland builds.

**The Thirty-Three-Year-Old Question**

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports

Darrin Davis tore his ACL last season in a game that did not matter. The A's had already clinched the division. The playoff rotation was set. Davis could have sat. He played anyway, because that is what Darrin Davis has always done.

He went down on a routine slide into second base in the seventh inning. The sound, witnesses said, was audible from the press box. Davis knew immediately. He waved off the trainers before they reached him. He walked off the field under his own power, because Davis has never let anyone carry him anywhere.

That was nine months ago. He is thirty-three years old now. He is on track to return for spring training. That is ahead of schedule. That is also the story Oakland has been telling itself all winter — that Davis will come back, that the knee will hold, that a former MVP can return to form after the kind of injury that ends careers.

I have covered this team for forty-four years. I have seen players return from injuries that should have finished them. I have also seen players who never looked the same. The difference is rarely medical. It is almost always about what the player believes he owes the game.

Davis believes he owes everything.

He won the MVP award in 2038. He hit .312 with 38 home runs and played elite production as a designated hitter. He was the best player on a team that won 102 games and reached the ALCS. The national media called him "the engine" of Oakland's offense. The local media knew better. Davis was not the engine. He was the example.

He showed up early. He stayed late. He treated spring training drills in February with the same intensity he brought to playoff games in October. The younger players watched him and learned that professionalism is not a performance. It is a standard.

Now he is thirty-three, rehabbing a torn ACL, trying to prove he can still be that example.

Deacon Seymour, Oakland's first-year manager, has not said much about Davis publicly. Seymour is smart enough to know that Davis does not need a manager to speak for him. Davis has always let his work do the talking. But Seymour also knows what this team needs. The A's have Benji Dillon chasing his sixth Cy Young. They have Vinnie Keane playing his farewell season in green and gold. They have a roster built to win now.

They need Darrin Davis to be Darrin Davis. Not the MVP version. Just the steady, professional, relentless version who makes everyone around him better.

The question is whether Davis, at thirty-three, with a surgically repaired knee, can still be that player. And the harder question — the one Oakland does not want to ask out loud — is what happens if he cannot.

This city has always respected the people who show up. Davis has shown up for a decade. He has given Oakland everything he has. He has played through injuries that would have sidelined other players. He has never complained. He has never asked for rest. He has treated every game like it mattered, even the ones that did not.

That is why he tore his ACL in a game the A's had already won. That is why he is rehabbing ahead of schedule. That is why he will report to Mesa in three weeks and try to prove he still belongs.

Oakland owes him the chance. The city owes him the patience. And if the knee does not hold — if Davis cannot be what he was — Oakland owes him the respect to say thank you without pretending it did not hurt.

I have watched Vinnie Keane prepare for his final season. I have watched Benji Dillon carry the weight of a rotation through six championships. I have watched this franchise honor the players who built the dynasty by giving them the space to finish their stories on their own terms.

Darrin Davis deserves the same. Whether that story ends with another Gold Glove or a quiet retirement announcement in July, Oakland will remember what he gave. And what he gave was everything.

The knee will either hold or it will not. The season will either extend the window or begin to close it. Davis will either return to form or he will not.

But the respect is already there. The gratitude is already earned. And when Davis walks onto the field in Mesa for the first time since that slide into second base, Oakland will be watching. Not to judge. To honor.

That is what this city has always done. That is what Darrin Davis has always deserved.

**After the Snub, the Statement**

By Selena Grant | Bulls Beat

Let's be precise about what happened Tuesday night at the United Center: Josh Giddey dropped 48 points, four rebounds, and 13 assists in a 111-102 win over Toronto. Career high. The Bulls improved to 40-16. Best record in the Eastern Conference.

And it was the first game after he was passed over for the All-Star team.

I'll say this plainly: the All-Star voting isn't a perfect system. It rewards name recognition and market size as much as production. Giddey's averaging 19.5 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 7.1 assists on 60.1% shooting from the field — those are All-Star numbers by any rational measure. The league disagreed. Chicago noticed.

"I heard about it," Giddey said after the game, still dripping sweat in the postgame tunnel. "I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody. Just playing basketball."

That might be the most Josh Giddey answer possible. The kid's averaging nearly a triple-double and he talks like he's apologizing for taking up space. But 48 points says something louder than words.

The question now is whether that performance was the statement or the start of something. Because what happened after Toronto tells a more complicated story.

Thursday, the Bulls lost to Detroit 111-102. The Pistons are third in the East at 37-18 — a legitimate contender — but the loss dropped Chicago to 40-17 and exposed some of the roster fragility Mike Paulson has been managing all season. Giddey was fine — 16 points, five rebounds, two assists — but not explosive. Jalen Smith had 17 and eight. The team looked ordinary.

Then came Saturday.

Matas Buzelis returned from a month-long absence with a pinched nerve. The starting lineup was whole again. And the Bulls dismantled the Knicks 131-92 in a performance that felt less like basketball and more like a public service announcement.

Giddey: 27 points, five rebounds, seven assists, two steals. Buzelis: 20 and three in his first game back. Adash Stanley: 18, eight, and five. The offense was crisp, the defense suffocating, and the margin so wide that the United Center crowd started chanting "MVP" for Giddey in the third quarter.

The Bulls are now 42-17 with 21 games remaining. They lead the conference by two games. The schedule ahead is brutal — Oklahoma City at home, then a four-game west coast road trip through Phoenix, Sacramento, Golden State, the Lakers, and the Clippers. After that, Memphis and a back-to-back against Cleveland and Toronto at home.

This is the part of the season where rosters prove what they are. Giddey's 48-point night was a reminder of his ceiling. The loss to Detroit was a reminder that the Bulls still need everyone healthy to reach it. The blowout win over New York was evidence that when they are, they're as dangerous as anyone in the league.

I've covered enough basketball to know that All-Star snubs sting. Some players shrink. Some players file it away and move on. And some players — the rare ones — use it as fuel for the rest of the season.

Giddey's shooting 60% from the field. The Bulls have the best record in the East. And the kid who got passed over just had the best week of his career.

Let's see if he's done making his case.

CHICAGO GROUND

**The Question at the Bar**

By Talia Finch | Chicago Ground

The beer at O'Malley's on Halsted was the same as always Wednesday morning — Goose Island on tap, poured into glasses that have survived more Chicago winters than most of the people drinking from them. What wasn't the same was the conversation at the bar.

A man in a Bulls jacket — red and black, the old Jordan-era colors — was scrolling through his phone. The trade notification was still on screen. Not a trade. A rumor. Golden State's interest in Mike Paulson was confirmed. No comment from Paulson.

"He just got us to 42-17," the man said, not looking up. He was maybe forty, construction boots still on, shirt with a company logo I didn't catch.

The bartender refilled his glass without asking.

"So he's leaving, right?" the man said.

That pause is the mood in Chicago right now.

It's not panic. The Bulls are winning. Giddey just dropped 48 after getting snubbed for the All-Star team. Buzelis is back. The United Center is loud again for the first time in years. This is supposed to be the good part.

But Paulson's from Bridgeport. The neighborhood claims him. So when the news comes out that Golden State is calling, it feels personal in a way that front office moves usually don't. He's not just the guy who built the roster. He's one of us.

I walked down to Bridgeport later that afternoon. The streets were quiet — February in Chicago always is — but the bars weren't. At a place on 35th, two women were watching highlights of the Knicks blowout on the overhead TV. One of them had a Bulls hat on. The other was drinking coffee like it was fuel.

"I don't blame him if he goes," the one with the hat said. "Golden State's Golden State."

Her friend nodded. "But it's gonna hurt."

That's the thing about this city. We're used to losing. We're good at it, even. But we're not used to this — having something worth keeping and wondering if it'll stay.

Paulson hasn't said anything. Maybe he's staying. Maybe he's already made the call. Maybe he's waiting to see how far this Bulls team can go before he decides.

All we know is the team's 42-17, the playoffs are coming, and the man who built the roster might be building someone else's next year.

The coffee at O'Malley's was dark. The conversation was darker. And somewhere across town, Mike Paulson wasn't commenting.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

**Dear Editor,**

I was at City Hall last week when the OARI vote happened. I sat through two hours of public comment, heard the council debate, watched Ramon Vega vote no and Leonard Tran vote yes. The whole thing passed 5-4. Everyone's celebrating like we just solved affordable housing. We didn't. We passed a framework. A structure. An implementation mechanism. I need someone to explain to me when the actual money shows up in the actual accounts. Because right now it feels like we threw a parade for a promise. I want to be wrong about this. I hope I'm wrong. But I've lived in West Oakland for thirty-two years and I've seen a lot of votes that were supposed to change things. The vote is step one. The money showing up is step two. Wake me up when we get to step two.

— Carla Edmonds, 58, West Oakland

**Dear Editor,**

Mark Aitken was at the OARI vote. I saw him. Sat three rows back from where the council members were. He's the son of the former mayor and he plays first base for the A's and now apparently he's interested in politics. Good. We need people who actually care about this city making decisions about this city. I don't know if he's thinking about running for something or if he just wanted to see how the sausage gets made. But he showed up. That counts for something. The A's are about to start spring training and he took time to sit in a council chamber and watch the OARI vote. I don't care what his politics are yet. I care that he was there. That's more than most people with a platform ever do.

— Vincent Cho, 41, Jack London

**Dear Editor,**

The Baylight vote is coming next week and I can already hear the arguments from both sides. I live on the waterfront. I walk past the proposed site every single day. I know what traffic looks like now. I know what parking looks like now. I know the sea levels aren't going down. I also know we need housing and we need development and we can't just freeze this city in amber and hope for the best. So I'm stuck. I want someone to tell me how we build something that doesn't drown in twenty years and doesn't choke the neighborhood in the meantime. I've read the DEIR. I have questions. I'm not against this. I'm just not sure anyone's answered the questions that matter yet. One week until the vote. I'm listening.

— Elena Reyes, 52, Downtown
