THE LOW-LAUNCH / HIGH-EV BREAKOUT TEMPLATE

Player Profile:

A hitter who already hits the ball extremely hard—top tier max exit velocity, consistent hard-hit rate—but keeps the ball too low. Think rocket-liners into the dirt. Analysts love the underlying metrics, fans wonder why the power isn’t showing up.

Identifying Traits:
	•	Max EV: Elite (ninety-fifth percentile or higher)
	•	Average Launch Angle: Low (zero to seven degrees)
	•	Hard-Hit Rate: High (forty percent or higher)
	•	Ground-Ball Rate: Too high (fifty percent or higher)
	•	Barrel Rate: Underperforming relative to EV (classic tell)

This is the exact “pre-breakout” signature in modern hitting analytics.

The Internal A’s Note (use for any season):

“The bat speed and contact authority are already elite. Trajectory inefficiency suppresses his production. A five-to-eight degree lift will unlock major extra-base potential.”

The Offseason Adjustment Arc:
	•	Works with hitting coordinator or biomech staff.
	•	Emphasis: adjust bat path, not “swing harder.”
	•	Targets: launch angle tightening, reducing negative/zero-degree contact.
	•	Introduces machine work on elevated fastballs to naturally create lift.
	•	Film study focuses on contact point in front of the plate.

This is where you can attach ANY story beat:
	•	Personal growth arc
	•	Veteran mentor
	•	Late-night cage work
	•	Small argument with hitting coach
	•	Secret tech lab session with Dillon
	•	Wrist injury recovery that accidentally created new mechanics

You can drop all of that in later. The template stays the same.

The Breakout Season Pattern:

Keep it believable and repeatable for any player you assign it to.

Before:
	•	Hard-hit rockets
	•	Lots of grounders
	•	Power suppressed
	•	Expected stats look better than real stats

After:
	•	Launch angle increases into twelve to eighteen degrees
	•	Barrel rate spikes
	•	HR total increases without any change in max EV
	•	Line-drive rate climbs
	•	Spray chart shifts to deeper alleys

This is EXACTLY how real-life breakouts happen.

Sample Before/After Stat Line (you can adapt these for any character):

Year N:
	•	.274 AVG
	•	17 HR
	•	48 barrels
	•	57% ground-ball rate
	•	Average LA: 4 degrees

Year N+1 (post adjustment):
	•	.291 AVG
	•	29 HR
	•	74 barrels
	•	43% ground-ball rate
	•	Average LA: 13 degrees

You can scale the numbers depending on the character’s archetype (power hitter, gap hitter, switch hitter, etc.).

Plug-and-Play Versions You Can Use Anywhere:

You can describe the player in your universe as:
	•	“A hitter who hits the ball too hard to be this ordinary.”
	•	“An exit-velocity monster trapped inside a ground-ball body.”
	•	“The analytics department’s favorite underachiever.”
	•	“A bat that needed altitude, not muscle.”
	•	“One swing-path tweak away from terrorizing pitchers.”

These lines fit Hal Richmond, Anthony, P Slayer, or TV broadcasters—anyone in your media ecosystem.
