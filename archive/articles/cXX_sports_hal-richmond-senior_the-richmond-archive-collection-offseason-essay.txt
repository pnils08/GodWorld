Quiet Roads After Parade Days
Oakland, California — February 2040
When you’ve written about the same team for nearly two decades, you learn the rhythm of their seasons the way sailors learn tides.  There’s the steady swell of April optimism, the cresting noise of midsummer, the hush that falls when October ends.  And then there’s this — the quiet road after parade days, when you can finally hear the sound of your own pen scratching across paper again.
Benji Dillon says he just wants one more year.  Nineteen point two million dollars, he calls it.  A price tag that isn’t really about money.  It’s a promise — to the game, to the city, to the ghosts of teammates who still linger in those green seats.  His fastball no longer whistles, but when you’ve seen a man win six rings, you stop judging him by radar guns.  You start watching how he walks into the clubhouse, how the younger arms stand a little taller just to match his stride.
John Brever, on the other hand, has the look I’ve seen in too many veterans.  Ten wins, ten losses, five point fifty one earned run average.  Numbers that whisper, not shout.  Once, he commanded games.  Now he commands memory.  The front office will find another starter — they always do.  Someone younger, cheaper, maybe steadier.  But there’s something unquantifiable about men like Brever.  They carry the weight of innings that no spreadsheet can measure.
I remember standing on Broadway after the two thousand thirty five parade, watching confetti stick to the streetcar rails.  The city smelled like beer and asphalt and history.  We didn’t know it then, but that was the last true crescendo.  Now, as we talk about innings eaters and backup catchers, it feels as though the dynasty has turned into an echo chamber of its own triumphs.  Yet there’s grace in that, too — in learning that legacy isn’t just what you did when the lights were bright, but how you handle the dimming.
Baseball has a way of testing continuity.  Players age, managers rotate, writers retire.  The only thing that stays is the record — the ink, the names, the quiet testimony that something beautiful once happened here.  And maybe that’s enough.  Maybe that’s what these quiet roads are for: to remind us that even after the parades are gone, the city still remembers where they began.
