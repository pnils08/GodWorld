Martin Richards: The Engineer of Joy
Oakland, California — 2040

If you want to understand Oakland, watch the way Martin Richards hits a line drive.  It’s clean, deliberate, and just slightly imperfect — like the city itself.  The third baseman from Maryland, known for his balance of intellect and instinct, has quietly become the A’s latest hometown philosopher.  His stat sheet gleams: .277 lifetime average, one hundred thirty-two home runs, four hundred sixty-one runs batted in, and two Gold Gloves.  But numbers can’t measure what Richards brings to the Coliseum: a calm...

Richards approaches the game like a designer.  Drafted in 2028, he came into the league with a mechanical engineering degree half-finished, a notebook full of sketches, and a knack for seeing symmetry where others saw stress.  “He sees baseball as moving parts,” says Mark Aitken, his longtime corner infield partner.  “He’s the only guy I’ve ever met who talks about torque ratios in the same breath as launch angles.”  Fans have taken to calling him The Engineer of Joy, a nickname that fits not just for his ...

Outside the lines, Richards has become a civic ambassador for STEM literacy.  Every Thursday in-season, he visits Bay Area middle schools to lead “Design the Game,” a workshop that connects geometry, physics, and baseball through hands-on projects.  Kids 3D-print model gloves, simulate curveball spins, and leave with tickets to the weekend’s game.  It’s less a publicity event and more a community manifesto.  “If they can see themselves solving a baseball problem,” Richards says, “they can see themselves s...

Mags describes his clubhouse presence as “still water with sparks underneath.”  Teammates talk about his meticulous routines — the pregame notebook entries, the slow walks through foul territory before first pitch.  He collects dirt samples from every stadium he plays in, labeling them by date and weather.  When asked why, he laughs: “It’s my way of studying friction.”  To the analytic age of baseball, he brings a kind of human math — the blend of wonder and method that makes the game both a science and...

For the community, Richards represents a kind of Oakland ideal: grounded, curious, unpretentious.  He donates half his appearance fees to the Oakland Robotics Collective, helping fund after-school labs in East and West Oakland.  In a recent interview, a student named Kalani summed up his impact perfectly: “He made math feel alive.  He made baseball feel smart.”  That line might as well be his biography.

Richards’s breakout 2039 season — ninety games, one hundred five hits, twenty-five home runs, and a...

When the lights fade and the players scatter, he’s often the last one on the field, adjusting chalk lines with his cleats, staring at the geometry of the diamond like a blueprint still in progress.  For a city forever rebuilding itself, Martin Richards might just be its most fitting mirror.
