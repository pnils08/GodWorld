The Shadow Core: Who’s Actually Most MLB-Ready

Every franchise has a top prospect list. Oakland has something different: a shadow core. A group of players who aren’t the loudest names, aren’t the headline prospects, but sit right beneath the surface waiting for the moment the organization calls. These aren’t long-term bets. These are players who could walk into the clubhouse tomorrow and not look out of place.

Here’s who’s closest.

John Ellis
He’s the obvious name, but he belongs here anyway. Ellis checks every box the front office cares about: fastball velocity that survives a second look, command that holds up under pressure, and a delivery that hasn’t broken down even with a growing workload. He’s not a question of “if.” He’s a question of scheduling.

Cy Newell
Newell’s stuff doesn’t pop the same way Ellis’ does, but the floor is higher than people think. His pitch mix is mature, the mound presence is real, and the ability to adjust mid-inning is the reason player development keeps pushing his timeline forward. He doesn’t need dominance to debut — he needs consistency. And he’s getting there.

Clark Saryan
If Ellis is the polished one and Newell is the sturdy one, Saryan is the volatility play with MLB movement already in the tank. His slider is a legitimate weapon right now. The question for him has always been the walk rate. If he tightens that even slightly, he’s the kind of arm that jumps straight past the depth chart.

Ernesto Quintero
He isn’t a pitcher, but he belongs on any MLB-readiness list. The power metrics and the recent developmental trend line put him closer than most realize. He still needs to prove that the lift adjustments hold up under actual game speed, but the organization treats him like a switch waiting to flip. Promoting him wouldn’t be reckless — it would be timely.

Johnny Carter
Relievers arrive in the majors differently. They don’t need three pitches. They need one great pitch and the confidence to lean on it. Carter has that. His fastball-cutter combo gives him a legitimate path to immediate innings if the big-league bullpen needs reinforcement. He’s not lights-out every outing, but when he’s right, he looks like he belongs.

The Shadow Core isn’t about star power. It’s about readiness — players who have finished developing and only need the right opportunity. Oakland has more of these players than the rest of the league realizes. And if injuries hit or performance dips, this group can keep the season from wobbling.

Every dynasty has its surface stars.
What separates Oakland is the group beneath them.
