Dr. Lila Mezran
"The Second Wave That Wasn't — And The Third That Might Be"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm going to walk you through what happened over the last twenty-two cycles because I think there's a story here that got lost in the noise.

Cycle 45: Temescal school absence spike. Level 2. Three elementary schools, one middle school, pediatric clusters in a six-block radius. We flagged it. The city flagged it. Parents kept kids home. The shock-flag triggered.

Cycles 46-50: The numbers didn't explode. They didn't collapse either. We sat in this uncomfortable middle space where the crisis arc stayed active but nothing dramatic happened. The shock-flag fired again at Cycle 48, again at 49, again at 50. County health never identified a pathogen. The absences normalized. Kids went back to school.

By Cycle 51, the first snow hit and everyone stopped thinking about respiratory illness and started thinking about pipes and power and whether their cars would start.

I thought we were done.

Cycle 63 changed that.

Three events in one cycle: missing funds at a city office, a five-minute blackout across three blocks, and — buried in the daily report — "unexplained symptom pattern."

That phrase again. The same phrase from the Downtown wave. The same phrase from the early Temescal reports.

I pulled the case files. The Cycle 63 symptoms don't match Temescal. They don't match Downtown. They're something else — cognitive fog, brief disorientation, no fever, no respiratory involvement. Three unrelated adults in three different neighborhoods reported nearly identical episodes within the same forty-eight-hour window.

The shock-flag triggered. Crisis arc reactivated.

Cycles 64-65 held the pattern. By Cycle 66, things stabilized. By Cycle 67, we're back to micro-event-wave territory.

Here's what I don't know: whether these three waves — Downtown respiratory, Temescal pediatric, and now this cognitive cluster — are connected. The symptom profiles are different. The demographics are different. The geography is different.

But the timing is strange. And the pattern-flags keep firing in ways that suggest the engine is seeing something we're not.

I'm not sounding an alarm. I'm noting that Oakland has now experienced three distinct health anomalies in thirty cycles, and we haven't explained any of them.

SECTION 2: CIVIC DESK
================================================================================

"Snow Day"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cycle 51. First snow.

Oakland doesn't get snow. That's not a complaint — it's a fact. The city isn't built for it. The infrastructure assumes rain, fog, cold. Not accumulation. Not ice.

So when it came down — light, wet, barely an inch before it started melting — the city stopped.

I walked the Temescal corridor that morning. Marcus Carter was at his security post on Telegraph, same as always, but he was standing outside the lobby doors instead of inside them.

"Had to see it," he said. "Grew up here. Forty-three years. Never seen it stick."

The schools didn't close. The buses ran late but they ran. The hospitals reported a small uptick in slip-and-fall injuries, nothing dramatic. By afternoon the streets were wet concrete again and the only evidence was the photos everyone posted.

But something shifted. You could feel it in the way people talked to each other. Strangers making eye contact. Comments about the weather that weren't complaints.

The snow came back at Cycle 60 and again at Cycle 67. By then it wasn't novel anymore. It was just winter. Oakland winter, which apparently now includes snow.

The infrastructure held. Mostly. Cycle 60 brought a three-block power flicker. Cycle 66 brought water-pressure drops and a transformer hiccup. Cycle 67 brought a signal malfunction during the snowfall.

None of it was catastrophic. All of it was the city adjusting to conditions it wasn't designed for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luis Navarro
"The Earthquake Nobody Felt"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cycle 54: earthquake rumble. Cycle 67: earthquake rumble.

I talked to twelve people after each one. Eight of them didn't notice anything. Three felt "something, maybe" but couldn't describe it. One — Elena Vasquez, 67, lifelong Oakland resident — said she knew immediately.

"The coffee in my cup moved," she told me. "Not spilled. Just... shifted. That's how you know."

The seismographs registered both events as minor. Sub-3.0. The kind of thing that happens constantly along the fault lines and never makes news.

But twice in thirteen cycles is more than background noise. And given everything else this city has absorbed — the health waves, the infrastructure hiccups, the civic pressure — people are paying attention to things they used to ignore.

Elena shrugged when I asked if she was worried.

"I've been through Loma Prieta. This isn't that. But this city feels like it's holding its breath, and I don't know what it's waiting for."

SECTION 3: SPORTS — OAKLAND
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anthony Reyes
"The Practice That Stopped"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cycle 57. A's practice disruption. Staff rumor.

I spent three days trying to figure out what happened. Here's what I know:

Practice was scheduled for 10 AM. Players arrived. Coaches arrived. At approximately 10:45, everyone was sent home. The facility wasn't closed — the fire from Cycle 44 had been repaired weeks earlier — but something happened that ended the session early.

Nobody would go on record. Three sources gave me three different versions:

Version one: Equipment failure. Something in the batting cages malfunctioned, precautionary shutdown.

Version two: Confrontation between a player and a coach. Voices raised. Seymour intervened. Session ended to let things cool down.

Version three: Phone call from Chicago. Paulson with instructions that contradicted what Seymour had planned. Seymour made a decision.

I don't know which one is true. Maybe all three contain pieces of the truth.

The "staff rumor" that showed up in the same cycle is equally murky. Something about a front office hire. Something about a scout being reassigned. Something about Paulson's dual-city arrangement creating confusion about reporting structures.

None of this is confirmed. All of it is the kind of noise that happens when an organization is in transition.

But here's what I keep coming back to: Deacon Seymour has never managed a game. He's running spring training prep for a roster that just underwent massive overhaul, with an MVP rehabbing from ACL surgery, with a GM who's literally running another team in another sport in another city, and the practice schedule got disrupted by something nobody will explain.

That's the state of the Oakland Athletics heading into spring training.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anthony Reyes
"They're Both Coming Back"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Darrin Davis will be at spring training.

The ACL rehab is on schedule. Sources say he's been hitting in the cage for two weeks, running bases for one. The leg is responding. The power is still there. Whether the explosiveness returns — the kind of burst that lets you go first-to-third on a single — remains to be seen.

But he'll be there. The MVP will be in uniform when camp opens.

And so will Vinnie Keane.

I'll admit I was wrong about this one. After the Harborline Grill dinner, after the retirement speculation, after the roster overhaul that seemed to be building around younger legs — I thought Keane was done. I thought he'd make the announcement quietly and ride off into the sunset with his .287 average and his veteran presence and his decade of Oakland loyalty.

Instead, he's heading to Arizona. Contract runs through 2041. He's honoring it.

I talked to someone close to the family. "Vinnie watched what they built this offseason. Coles, Tavares, the pitching depth. He wants to see what it looks like when it's all on the field together. He thinks they can win."

That's the thing about this roster. On paper, it might be the most talented team Paulson has ever assembled. Rivas in his prime. Coles at 21 with a 2.05 ERA. Davis if he's healthy. Keane if he's got one more year in him. Tavares locked up long-term. Dillon back for one more ride.

The question is whether Deacon Seymour can make it work. And whether Mike Paulson will be paying enough attention to help him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hal Richmond — Senior Historian
"What We Carry Into Spring"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been thinking about what this team is bringing to Arizona.

They're bringing an MVP who hasn't played a competitive game since the injury. They're bringing a 21-year-old ace who's never pitched in front of an Oakland crowd. They're bringing a new manager who's never filled out a lineup card that counted.

They're bringing a GM who walked out of a press conference and never came back to explain himself. Who made an unauthorized prediction about a health crisis and got publicly rebuked by county health. Who then proceeded to build a basketball team in Chicago that might be the best story in the NBA.

They're bringing a veteran in Vinnie Keane who everyone assumed was finished and who decided, against all reasonable expectation, to come back for one more year.

They're bringing Benji Dillon, 38 years old, $13 million, one year, because he believes in what this roster could be.

They're bringing the memory of the practice fire. The disrupted session in Cycle 57. The staff rumors nobody will confirm.

They're bringing all of it.

And somewhere in Oakland, the health desk is still tracking unexplained symptom patterns, and the civic desk is still noting infrastructure stress, and the population is still drifting downward at thirty souls per cycle, and the winter keeps cycling between snow and fog and rain like the weather can't decide what kind of city this is anymore.

Spring training starts soon. The games will start after that. And eventually Mike Paulson will have to stand in the tunnel at the Coliseum and face the city he left holding his words.

I don't know what happens then. But I know we're carrying a lot into spring. Heavy bags. Open questions.

Maybe that's what Oakland has always done. Carried weight. Asked questions. Kept moving.

SECTION 4: CHICAGO SATELLITE TRANSMISSION
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selena Grant | Bulls Beat
"The Run Nobody Expected"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They're in the NBA Cup semifinals.

Write that down. Put it somewhere you'll remember. Because six weeks ago, this was supposed to be a developmental year. This was supposed to be about Buzelis learning to be a pro and Trepagnier figuring out whether his summer league form was real and Giddey adjusting to a new system.

Instead, the Bulls are playing meaningful basketball in December.

The run has been led by exactly the players Paulson bet on. Josh Giddey is averaging a near-triple-double. His vision is translating into easy baskets for everyone around him. The 17-assist game on opening night wasn't a fluke — it was a preview.

Matas Buzelis has been everything the front office hoped and more. The 28-point opener announced him; the consistency since has confirmed him. He's not just scoring — he's defending, rebounding, making the right reads.

Hank Trepagnier didn't keep shooting 100%. Nobody does. But he's been the most efficient big man in the Eastern Conference, and his rim protection has transformed Chicago's defensive ceiling. The kid from El Salvador who played fútbol until he was fifteen is anchoring a playoff-caliber defense.

And then there's Adash Stanley.

The Polish teenager with the weird shooting form and the 99 hustle rating has become the spark plug off the bench. When he enters the game, the pace changes. The energy changes. He doesn't stop moving. He doesn't stop shooting. And somehow, despite the unconventional mechanics, the ball keeps going in.

Four players. Three of them 21 or younger. One of them undrafted. This is what Paulson built.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marcello Reyes | League Analysis
"The Giannis Question, Revisited"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Milwaukee is struggling.

I'm not going to pretend I know what that means for the trade market, but I know what it means for the conversation. When I wrote about the Giannis rumors after opening night, it felt speculative. Theoretical. The kind of thing you mention because it's technically possible, not because it's likely.

Now?

The Bulls have draft capital. They have young players on team-friendly deals. They have cap flexibility from the Vucevic and DeRozan trades. And they're winning.

Milwaukee has an MVP entering his prime with a supporting cast that isn't working and a front office that's running out of moves.

I'm not saying a trade is coming. I'm saying the conditions that make a trade possible are more present now than they were six weeks ago.

What would Chicago give up? Probably not Buzelis — he's the franchise cornerstone. But would they move draft picks? Multiple firsts? Would they include someone like Walker Kessler or Kevin Huerter to make the money work?

The Giannis-Giddey pairing would be devastating. The lob threat alone would break defenses. And Giannis next to Trepagnier in the frontcourt — two physical, versatile bigs who can switch everything — would be the best defensive duo in the league.

This is all speculation. But it's more informed speculation than it was a month ago. Paulson is building something. The league knows it. And Milwaukee has to decide whether they want to be part of what comes next or watch it happen from the outside.

Talia Finch | Ground Report
"Benchmark Believers"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I went back to Benchmark Bar for the NBA Cup quarterfinal.

Remember Marcus? The optimist? The one buying rounds on opening night saying "I told you"?

He's still there. But he's not alone anymore.

The crowd was three times the size of opening night. The TVs were all tuned to the game. Nobody was doing mock draft math because nobody's thinking about the draft anymore. They're thinking about now.

DeShawn — the numbers guy — told me he's stopped calculating lottery odds. "What's the point? We're winning games. Real games. I don't even know how to process this."

Janelle, the skeptic from opening night, bought a Buzelis jersey. I asked her what changed.

"I watched him defend Giannis for a possession," she said. "Twenty-one years old, guarding the best player in the world, and he didn't back down. He competed. That's when I knew this was different."

The bar erupted when Trepagnier threw down an alley-oop in the fourth quarter. Someone spilled a drink. Nobody cared.

This is what it looks like when a city starts believing in something it forgot how to believe in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selena Grant | Bulls Beat
"Paulson's Second City"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been trying to figure out how to write about Mike Paulson without writing about Oakland.

I can't.

Everything he's doing here — the roster construction, the player development, the system design — is informed by what he learned there. The Travis Coles trade in Oakland is the template for how he acquired assets in Chicago. The Eric Tavares signing is why he trusted Stanley despite the unconventional profile.

But Oakland is also the thing hanging over him.

He walked out of a press conference. He made a statement about a health crisis he had no authority to make. He got publicly rebuked. And then he flew to Chicago and built a basketball team while his baseball team navigated one of the most chaotic offseasons in franchise history without him physically present.

The Bulls are playing for an NBA Cup championship. The A's are heading to spring training with open questions about who's really running the show.

Paulson exists in both cities simultaneously. He's building legacies in both. And at some point, he's going to have to answer for both.

The Bulls are the good story right now. The unexpected run. The young players exceeding expectations. The franchise resurrection.

But Oakland is still out there. Still waiting. Still holding what he said.

"Thirty Days of Winter"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This city has been through something.

I'm not sure we have a name for it yet. Not a crisis — nothing exploded. Not a disaster — the infrastructure held, mostly. Not a triumph — the A's haven't played a game, the health desk is still tracking patterns, the fog still rolls in and makes everyone drive slower.

But something happened. Twenty-two cycles of accumulation. Snow that shouldn't fall. Earthquakes that nobody felt. Blackouts that lasted five minutes. Practices that stopped early. Rumors that nobody confirmed.

And through all of it, the city kept moving. People went to work. Kids went back to school. The Winter Riverfront Festival ran its course. The Twilight Teahouse stayed open. Bridge & Barrel served drinks.

Colin Lee at the Teahouse told me something that stuck: "The city is asking you to pay attention and you're finally listening."

I think he's right. We're paying attention now. To the health data. To the infrastructure. To the sports franchises that carry our name and the executives who control them.

Mike Paulson's Bulls are playing for a championship. Mike Paulson's A's are heading to spring training with an MVP coming off surgery and a manager who's never managed. Mike Paulson walked out of a room and built something extraordinary in another city and never came back to explain himself here.

That's the winter we had. That's what we're carrying into spring.

The snow will melt. The fog will lift. Opening day will come.

And Oakland will still be here. Watching. Waiting. Paying attention.
