HEALTH CENTER PASSES 6-2, BUT CRANE'S ABSENCE SHIFTS COUNCIL DYNAMICS

By Carmen Delaine | Civic Ledger | Bay Tribune

The Temescal Community Health Center appropriation cleared Oakland City Council Tuesday in a 6-2 vote, securing $45 million for the facility that city health officials have called "urgently necessary." But the vote's most notable feature wasn't who voted yes — it was who wasn't there at all.

District 6 Councilmember Elliott Crane, still recovering from the broken leg sustained three cycles ago, was absent for the vote. He participated remotely for the Stabilization Fund vote in Cycle 78, casting the crossover YES that fractured the Civic Reform Coalition. But Tuesday, his chair sat empty.

The YES coalition: Denise Carter (D1), Leonard Tran (D2), Rose Delgado (D3), Ramon Vega (D4), Janae Rivers (D5), and Warren Ashford (D7). Nina Chen (D8) and Terrence Mobley (D9) voted NO.

Ashford's YES represents a quiet reversal from his previous silence on health policy. Carmen Delaine covered his noncommittal stance in Edition 79 — "Ashford's position as D7 representative remains noncommittal while health indicators worsen in the neighborhood." On Tuesday, he voted YES without comment.

Tran's YES aligns with his independent voting record. He and Vega have now voted together on both the Stabilization Fund and the Health Center — two votes that required crossing traditional factional lines.

The Health Center will be sited near the intersection of Telegraph and 51st Street, serving Temescal and surrounding neighborhoods. Funding comes from the city's infrastructure reserve, approved as part of the 2039 capital improvement budget. Construction is expected to begin within six months.

Dr. Lila Mezran, who has tracked Temescal health patterns for the Tribune, noted in her Edition 79 coverage that the Health Center vote was projected 5-4 with Ashford's position as the fulcrum. The final 6-2 margin suggests broader consensus than expected.

But Crane's absence raises questions about the Council President's timeline for return. Chief of Staff Laila Cortez offered no comment on his status. Deputy Mayor for Community Affairs Brenda Okoro confirmed the facility timeline but did not address Crane's role in future votes.

Oakland Alternative Response Initiative comes before council in Cycle 82. Baylight District final vote is scheduled for Cycle 83. Both are projected 5-4 margins. If Crane remains absent, the math changes.

THE CHECK IS COMING — BUT WEST OAKLAND ISN'T HOLDING ITS BREATH

By Carmen Delaine | Civic Ledger | Bay Tribune

The Stabilization Fund passed three cycles ago. The 45-day disbursement clock is running. And in West Oakland, residents are asking the same question they've been asking since the council voted 6-3 to release $28 million from the city's emergency reserve: Where's the money?

"I filled out the intake form two weeks ago," said Darius Clark, 40, a bakery worker on Seventh Street. "I got a confirmation email. I got a case number. I haven't heard anything since."

City Administrator's office confirms the intake system is live. Applications are being processed. Disbursements are "on track" to begin within the 45-day window. But details remain scarce.

"We're building the infrastructure in real time," said a source within the administrator's office who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. "The fund passed faster than we expected. We're scaling up to meet demand."

The Stabilization Fund targets West Oakland residents and small businesses facing economic strain tied to migration shifts, housing pressure, and the broader stresses documented in civic load data. Eligible applicants can receive up to $15,000 in direct assistance for rent, utilities, business expenses, or emergency costs.

But the pipeline isn't simple. Applications require proof of residency, income documentation, and a detailed account of need. Processing involves the City Administrator's office, the Department of Housing and Community Development, and a newly formed Stabilization Fund Review Board.

"This isn't just handing out checks," said Councilwoman Janae Rivers (D5), who represents parts of West Oakland. "It's making sure the money reaches people who need it most, and that we're not creating new problems in the process."

Community Director Hayes, who has worked in West Oakland for eighteen years, sees the bureaucratic caution as both necessary and frustrating. "I understand the city needs accountability. But every week that passes is another week someone's choosing between rent and groceries."

Disbursements are expected to begin within two weeks. The first batch will prioritize applicants facing eviction or utility shutoff. The second batch will address small business stabilization. The third batch will cover emergency costs and short-term relief.

The Stabilization Fund vote fractured the Civic Reform Coalition, with Elliott Crane casting the crossover YES that secured passage. His absence from Tuesday's Health Center vote — which passed 6-2 without him — raises questions about his timeline for return and the coalition's cohesion heading into two more critical votes: Oakland Alternative Response Initiative (Cycle 82) and Baylight District (Cycle 83).

West Oakland waits. The clock runs. And the question remains: Is the infrastructure to distribute $28 million actually ready?

DOWNTOWN BUCKLES UNDER POPULATION SURGE AS SUMMER FESTIVAL CROWDS ARRIVE

By Trevor Shimizu | Transit & Infrastructure | Bay Tribune

Downtown Oakland is operating at tolerance limits.

Population growth in the district hit 33% this cycle — the highest single-cycle increase recorded in Tribune civic tracking. The surge coincides with Summer Festival preparations, seasonal retail activity, and an ongoing migration pattern that has funneled residents into the city's commercial core.

The result: strain on infrastructure, transit bottlenecks, and visible pressure on public services.

"Broadway and 14th is gridlock by 9 a.m.," said Bruce Wright, 48, a line cook who commutes from the East Bay. "Used to be I could park within three blocks of work. Now I'm circling for twenty minutes."

BART reported capacity delays on Downtown Oakland and 12th Street stations during peak morning hours. AC Transit logged increased ridership on Lines 51A and 72R. Parking enforcement issued 18% more citations this cycle compared to the previous period.

But the strain isn't just transit. Sanitation crews are running double shifts to manage increased waste volume. Public restrooms in Frank Ogawa Plaza are operating beyond design capacity. Police logged twelve noise complaints related to late-night crowds near bars and restaurants on Telegraph Avenue.

City Planning Director Mara Vance declined to comment on Downtown population patterns but confirmed that environmental review for the Baylight District — scheduled for a council vote in Cycle 83 — includes infrastructure impact assessments for Downtown and Jack London Square.

The Summer Festival officially begins next cycle. Crowds are expected to intensify.

Downtown merchants report strong retail activity. Restaurants are booked. Hotels are at capacity. But the pressure is visible: longer wait times, slower service, and a city core operating at the edge of its design tolerance.

"This is what growth looks like," said Dante Nelson, 41, a security guard who works near City Hall. "It's good for business. But it's hell for everyone trying to get through their day."

OPOA PRESSURE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES IN DISTRICT 4 AS OARI VOTE NEARS

By Luis Navarro | Investigations | Bay Tribune

The Oakland Police Officers Association isn't waiting for the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative to reach the council floor. They're organizing now.

OPOA held a public forum in the Fruitvale last cycle. Mailers targeting District 4 constituents began arriving in Adams Point mailboxes three cycles ago. And this cycle, the union announced a series of community meetings designed to "educate residents about the risks of untested public safety experiments."

The OARI vote is scheduled for Cycle 82 — two cycles from now. The proposal would create a civilian-led alternative response unit to handle non-violent mental health crises, homelessness outreach, and low-level disturbances currently managed by Oakland Police Department officers.

District 4 Councilmember Ramon Vega, who serves as Council President, is the swing vote. He voted YES on the Stabilization Fund. He voted YES on the Health Center. His position on OARI remains publicly uncommitted.

"I'm listening to constituents," Vega said in a brief statement to the Tribune. "This is a complex proposal with significant implications for public safety. I'm not making a decision until I've heard all sides."

But OPOA isn't leaving that decision to chance. The union's mailers frame OARI as a budget risk, a staffing challenge, and a liability concern. The community meetings feature active-duty officers, retired sergeants, and public safety experts who argue that civilian response units lack the training and authority to handle unpredictable situations.

OARI supporters — including Councilmembers Denise Carter (D1), Rose Delgado (D3), Janae Rivers (D5), and Terrence Mobley (D9) — argue that the current system over-relies on armed police for situations that don't require law enforcement presence. They cite successful alternative response programs in Denver, Eugene, and Los Angeles.

The vote projection remains toss-up. The CRC bloc (Ashford, Chen, and Crane if he returns) is expected to vote NO. The OPP bloc (Carter, Delgado, Rivers, Mobley) is expected to vote YES. Vega and Tran are the swing votes.

Elliott Crane's absence from Tuesday's Health Center vote raises questions about his participation in the OARI floor vote. If he remains absent, the math shifts.

District 4 watches. The mailers keep coming. And OPOA's campaign continues to build momentum ahead of a vote that could reshape Oakland's approach to public safety.

Names Index: Ramon Vega (D4, IND, Council President), Denise Carter (D1, OPP), Rose Delgado (D3, OPP), Janae Rivers (D5, OPP), Terrence Mobley (D9, OPP), Warren Ashford (D7, CRC), Nina Chen (D8, CRC), Elliott Crane (D6, CRC), Leonard Tran (D2, IND)

BUSINESS TICKER — CYCLE 80

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

SummerFestival week delivered the numbers. Retail corridors stayed hot from Jack London through Downtown and east to Fruitvale, with visitor spending powering a sustained commercial surge. The festival landed in Oakland's economic sweet spot — mid-July, warm but overcast, high community engagement. Restaurants filled early and stayed full. Shops moved inventory. Nightlife volume climbed and held.

— Retail load: Elevated across all commercial corridors. Downtown, Jack London, Temescal, Fruitvale, Lake Merritt all active.
— Economic influence: Elevated. Festival tourism dominant force. Visitor spending fills hotels, restaurants, retail.
— Trend: Festival-adjacent momentum. Spending not limited to event sites — radiates across neighborhoods.
— Top dining: Jack London waterfront restaurants, Uptown evening establishments.
— Fast casual: Temescal corridor consistent.
— Nightlife volume: 1.78 (elevated, festive energy)
— Active spots: Jack London venues, Uptown district, KONO galleries.

The overcast marine layer held temperature in the comfortable range all week — optimal conditions for outdoor dining and prolonged street traffic. Ten neighborhoods currently show strong retail vitality: Downtown, Jack London, Rockridge, Temescal, Fruitvale, Lake Merritt, West Oakland, Laurel, Chinatown, and Grand Lake. That kind of geographic breadth is rare. When the money moves this wide, Oakland works.

THE MONEY QUESTION: STABILIZATION FUND ENTERS IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

The $28 million West Oakland Stabilization Fund moved from political victory to operational reality this cycle. The 45-day disbursement clock is running. City economic development staff are finalizing application protocols for the first tranche: lease stabilization grants targeting existing businesses facing rent escalation along the Seventh Street and Mandela Parkway corridors.

This is the part nobody writes headlines about — the unglamorous backend work of getting public money into the right accounts without triggering compliance failures or equity complaints. But it matters more than the vote.

SummerFestival week provided a useful stress test for the fund's core thesis. While Jack London and Downtown absorbed heavy visitor traffic and posted elevated retail numbers, the western corridors that the Stabilization Fund was designed to protect saw a more modest bump. Festival tourists filled waterfront restaurants and Uptown bars. West Oakland businesses waited for the spillover that never quite arrived.

Geographic imbalance persists. The festival economy flows east and stays east. That is the pattern the Stabilization Fund aims to disrupt — not with events or branding, but with direct capital infusions designed to stabilize existing businesses and attract new tenants to vacant commercial spaces.

The fund's architecture breaks into three categories: lease stabilization for businesses facing rent increases, capital improvement micro-loans for facade and equipment upgrades, and corridor activation grants to fill long-vacant storefronts. City staff have indicated that lease stabilization will move first, given urgency around several pending rent renegotiations set to take effect before September.

What matters now is execution. The political coalition that passed the fund delivered the money. City Administrator's office owns the rollout. Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei, who typically oversees economic development, remains in serious condition and unavailable for implementation oversight. That absence complicates the pipeline.

SummerFestival proved again that Oakland has the consumer demand. The city posted some of its strongest retail and nightlife numbers of the year. The Stabilization Fund's bet is simple: build the floor, and the spending will follow. Forty-five days and counting.

SUMMERFESTIVAL IN THE FOG: OAKLAND CELEBRATES A HOLIDAY IT BUILT ITSELF
Faith Communities, Block Parties, and the Question of What Gets Remembered

By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison

The smoke found you before the music did.

On Telegraph Avenue near 49th Street, a grill was already working by eleven in the morning. Chicken thighs, tri-tip, chorizo sizzling on the flat top. The smell rolled down the block like something with weight. A folding table held potato salad in a blue bowl, watermelon slices on a plastic platter, and a sheet cake decorated with the words "Summer Is Here" in letters that were already melting in the overcast heat.

That's Oakland — not perfect, not rich, not pretty, but permanent.

SummerFestival is an Oakland holiday. Not a county thing. Not a Bay Area celebration that stretches to San Jose and back. It belongs to this city, to the neighborhoods that decided a long time ago that summer deserves its own day, its own rhythm, its own excuse to close the street and fire up the grill and let the kids run until the light fades.

I spent the day walking. Temescal to Lake Merritt to Fruitvale to Downtown. What I found was not a single celebration but a city holding dozens of small ones at once — each neighborhood marking the holiday in its own way, each gathering shaped by who lives there and what they've decided matters.

In Fruitvale, the streets near St. Columba Catholic Church were thick with families. The church had activated its emergency assistance fund earlier in the cycle — a quiet signal that need persists even in a season of celebration — but on SummerFestival morning, the focus was on gathering. The smell of tamales, the sound of music spilling from open car doors, children chasing each other in circles around folding chairs.

Calvin Turner, a mechanic I've spoken to before, was working a double but had already put in his hours at his family's backyard gathering. "My wife's people have been doing this since we moved here," he said. "SummerFestival is ours. You don't explain it to people who don't live here. You just show up."

At Allen Temple Baptist Church in East Oakland, the congregation held a community health fair — blood pressure checks, wellness screenings, tables loaded with information about free clinics and nutrition programs. The church's choir had performed during services earlier in the cycle, but today the sanctuary was empty and the action was outside: volunteers in matching T-shirts, families moving from table to table, seniors sitting in folding chairs in the shade.

Jose Wright, an electrician from Temescal, had driven out to East Oakland specifically for the health fair. "I heard they were doing it," he said. "My dad's blood pressure's been all over the place. Figured I'd bring him. Got it checked, talked to a nurse, walked away with actual information. That's what the churches do here. They just do it."

Downtown, First Presbyterian Church had hosted a choir performance the week before, and the sound still lingered in the neighborhood's memory. At Lake Merritt, the scene was dense. Families claimed every bench. Blankets covered the grass. Food trucks lined the paths, and the smell of fried dough and grilled onions competed with the smoke from portable grills that people had hauled down to the water's edge.

Elijah Campbell, a taxi driver from Adams Point, was parked near the lake, watching the crowd. "SummerFestival hits different," he said. "People are out. Not going anywhere special. Just being together. That's Oakland. You feel the city. Even when it's overcast like today, people still show up."

The gathering wasn't without friction. A dispute over a food truck line near the boathouse required intervention. A sparkler burn incident in Rockridge was treated on scene. In Chinatown, a BBQ grill flare-up drew an emergency response — no injuries, no damage, just the sharp reminder that a holiday built around open flame carries inherent risk.

But the texture of SummerFestival is not primarily about disruption. It is about the weight of gathering. It is about a city that decided summer deserves its own day, and then built that day from the ground up, neighborhood by neighborhood, grill by grill, without asking permission from anyone.

Marco Johnson, a nurse aide from Adams Point, was sitting on a bench near the water with a plate balanced on his knee. "I work nights usually," he said. "So SummerFestival is one of the few times I'm actually out here when it's busy. It's a lot. But it's good. You see Oakland being Oakland."

WHEN THE CITY DECIDES TO STAY OUT LATE
Oakland's Nightlife Surge, Cultural Buzz, and the Artists Who Feed It

By Kai Marston | Arts & Entertainment

The air was already shifting on Telegraph by seven o'clock.

You could feel it in the way the foot traffic thickened between 23rd and 40th — that particular summer-night compression where the sidewalk stops being a sidewalk and becomes a current. The galleries had their windows lit. The food trucks were settling into position along the side streets. And somewhere up the block near Temescal, a sound system was testing levels, bass notes rolling down the asphalt like something searching for a wall to bounce off of.

SummerFestival week carried a charge. The overcast sky, sixty-two degrees and holding, kept the light soft through the evening. No glare. No heat exhaustion. Just that gray-pearl Oakland summer twilight that makes neon signs and stage lighting pop like they were designed for exactly this weather.

In Uptown, the energy was building. Rico Valez — one of Oakland's most visible arts figures — was spotted moving between venues, that particular kind of presence that draws a crowd without announcing itself. Nearby, Lena Cross, the actor whose name keeps appearing in gallery conversations and arts coverage, was out on Broadway, stopping to talk to admirers between shows.

Down in KONO, Sculptor Alma Vasquez had new work visible through the broad front window of her studio — steel and reclaimed wood pieces that looked like they were arguing with each other about what a bridge is supposed to do. A small crowd gathered on the sidewalk, peering in.

Up the avenue in Piedmont, Marin Tao — Oakland's highest-profile arts celebrity — was seen at a gathering near the boutique row, the kind of sighting that rippled through social media feeds and confirmed what the avenue already knew: SummerFestival week was a night worth showing up for.

The music situation was layered. Jade Orion, the Temescal musician whose name circulates in local arts circles, was performing on a side-street stage near Telegraph — a set that blended electronic textures with live guitar, the kind of sound that rewards standing still in a crowd that keeps moving.

Sage Vienta, the Piedmont Avenue actor whose profile has been climbing, was spotted in the Uptown crowd — another confirmation that Oakland's arts scene was consolidating around a night that felt bigger than usual.

Over in Jack London, the nightlife surge was building momentum. Jalen Hill, a line cook at a Jack London spot, was deep into service when the wave hit. "You can feel it in the ticket rail," he said during a brief pause. "Around eight, eight-thirty, the orders just stack. People order more, they share more, they try things. The plates come back different when the city's in this mood."

Marcus Walker, a dishwasher at another Jack London establishment, had a more philosophical take. "I've been washing dishes in this city for a long time," he said. "Summer nights like this, you see it in the volume. People stay out. The night stretches. We prep for it, but it still hits."

What makes Oakland's cultural energy endure, cycle after cycle, is that it is not curated from above. It is an accumulation — artists deciding to show up, musicians deciding to play, galleries deciding to stay open, people deciding to walk.

THE CHURCHES THAT NEVER CLOSE
Faith Infrastructure Holds Oakland Together During SummerFestival Week

By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison

The food pantry line at Cathedral of Christ the Light started forming before the doors opened.

It does every time. Lake Merritt knows the schedule. Families, seniors, people who drove and people who walked — they gathered on the sidewalk in the overcast morning light, patient and familiar with the routine. Inside, volunteers sorted cans and produce into bags. Outside, the line grew. This is what the cathedral does: it feeds people. It has been feeding people for a long time, and it will feed people next month, and the month after that.

But the cathedral was not alone this cycle. The emergency assistance fund had been activated earlier in the week — a step that signals real, material need among parishioners. On SummerFestival morning, the focus was on service. The food pantry operated at full capacity, a parallel effort to similar programs running across the city at Allen Temple, at the Islamic Center, at Kehilla Synagogue, at First Unitarian.

Across Oakland, houses of worship mobilized with an intensity that spoke to both the season and the need. SummerFestival is a holiday that fills parks and backyards, but for Oakland's faith communities, it was also a week of service — food pantries, health fairs, choir performances, grief gatherings, emergency funds.

At First Presbyterian Church downtown, a choir performance had drawn the faithful earlier in the cycle. Howard Young, a barista in Rockridge, told me he'd heard the music walking past. "I'm not a churchgoing person," he said. "But I know what the churches do. Everybody knows. When things get hard, that's where people go. Not city hall. The church."

In Temescal, the Islamic Center of Oakland had organized a community grief gathering — a response to loss that the congregation chose to hold collectively. The center's presence in the neighborhood extends beyond prayer to practical work: food pantries, community events, the everyday infrastructure that holds a neighborhood together.

In West Oakland, Acts Full Gospel Church marked a milestone in its seniors lunch program — a program that has been feeding elderly residents with the kind of regularity that becomes invisible until you imagine it gone.

Gallery Owner Mei Chen, the Laurel-based curator who has been documenting the faith community's work as an ongoing project, sees a pattern that outsiders miss. The documentation effort — capturing what these institutions do week after week — matters because it makes visible what Oakland often takes for granted: that the city's safety net is not only made of government programs.

Brian Williams, a mechanic in Chinatown, put it simply. "I go to temple sometimes," he said. "Not every week. But I know they're there. That's the thing — they're always there."

WIFFLEBALL IN TEMESCAL: HOW A'S PLAYERS SHOWED UP AFTER THE VOTES

By Tanya Cruz | Sideline Reporter | Bay Tribune Sports

The wiffleball tournament moved to Temescal this week, and if you weren't paying attention to the calendar, you might have missed why.

Saturday afternoon at Temescal Creek Park. Danny Horn standing near the makeshift backstop with a bat over his shoulder, watching twelve-year-olds argue over strike zones. Vinnie Keane coaching first base in a faded A's cap that looked older than half the kids on the field. Amara Keane keeping score on a clipboard that kept blowing sideways in the wind.

The tournament was supposed to be in West Oakland. It moved after the Temescal Community Health Center vote passed six-to-two on Tuesday night. Mark Aitken was there for that vote. He didn't speak, didn't grandstand, just sat in the back row and watched the council approve funding for mental health counseling, preventative care clinics, and a mobile unit that'll serve seniors who can't make it to the main facility.

Two days later, the wiffleball tournament relocated to Temescal Creek Park. Horn sponsored it. Aitken showed up to coach. Deacon Seymour made his first public appearance since taking the manager job, standing near the third-base line in sunglasses and a windbreaker, watching the kids play.

Mike Paulson was there for ninety minutes. He didn't coach. He didn't throw out a first pitch. He stood near the snack table with Ernesto Quintero, the A's director of community outreach, and watched Horn strike out a ten-year-old on three straight pitches.

"Danny's got no mercy," Paulson said, smiling. "Even in wiffleball."

Horn heard that from across the field. "Mercy's for the regular season," he shouted back.

The mood was light, but the subtext wasn't hard to find. This wasn't just a wiffleball game. It was a statement. The health center vote passed because the city decided Temescal needed infrastructure that could respond to what's been happening in the streets — the overdoses, the mental health crises, the calls that don't need a badge but do need someone who knows what they're doing.

And the A's showed up to say: We see it. We're here.

Aitken spent most of the afternoon working with a group of kids on their swings. He's not loud. He doesn't draw attention. But he's precise. He adjusted grips, fixed stances, corrected weight distribution. One kid, maybe fourteen, asked him if he was nervous about the Baylight District vote in three cycles.

"Not nervous," Aitken said. "Focused."

Seymour didn't say much. He watched, took notes on his phone, and left after two hours. When asked if this was part of his community engagement strategy as the new manager, he shook his head.

"I'm not here as the manager," Seymour said. "I'm here because Danny asked me to come."

Horn's been living in Temescal for six years. He knows the park. He knows the families. When the health center vote passed, he called Quintero and said they should move the tournament. Not because West Oakland didn't deserve it. Because Temescal just got something, and the city should see the players acknowledge it.

"This is what it looks like when the city invests in neighborhoods," Horn said. "You show up. You don't wait for them to ask."

Vinnie Keane didn't give interviews. He coached first base for four hours, high-fived every runner who touched the bag, and left with Amara when the sun started dropping behind the hills. Someone asked him if this was part of his farewell season.

"This is just Saturday," Keane said.

Paulson left before the final game. He had a flight to Chicago. He's got the Bulls' game against Memphis on Monday night, then he's back in Mesa on Thursday for the A's second week of spring training. The schedule's brutal, but he doesn't complain. He just moves.

Before he left, he stood near the dugout and watched Horn pitch to a kid who couldn't have been more than eight years old. The kid swung late on three straight pitches, then connected on the fourth and sent the ball sailing over Horn's head.

Horn turned and watched it land near the outfield fence. Then he looked at the kid and nodded.

"That's one," Horn said.

The kid ran the bases. Horn walked back to the mound. Paulson got in his car and drove to the airport.

Saturday in Temescal. Wiffleball and sunlight. A's players in the park, two days after the city voted to fund a health center that might save lives.

This is what it looks like when the franchise shows up.

WARRIORS ON FIRE: GIANNIS ERA BEGINS WITH FIVE STRAIGHT WINS

By Anthony | Lead Beat Reporter | Bay Tribune Sports

There's a rhythm to championship windows. You can hear it before you see it. The spacing tightens. The defense starts to suffocate. The offense stops forcing and starts flowing. The Warriors have won five straight games since acquiring Giannis Antetokounmpo, and the rhythm is already there.

Golden State sits at thirty-one and twenty-four, fifth in the Western Conference. Not dominant. Not desperate. Just dangerous.

Steph Curry was named the All-Star starting point guard on Thursday. Jimmy Butler made the reserve roster. Giannis will start at forward. All-Star Weekend in Indianapolis is two weeks away, and the Warriors will send three players to the showcase for the first time since the championship years.

But the real story isn't the All-Star selections. It's the five-game win streak. It's the way Giannis has fit into the offense without disrupting it. It's the way Curry's playing like he's thirty again. It's the way Butler's taken on the defensive assignments that used to belong to Draymond Green, and somehow made them his own.

The Warriors beat Portland by eighteen. They beat Phoenix by seven. They beat the Clippers by twelve. They beat Denver in overtime. They beat the Lakers on a Curry three-pointer with four seconds left.

That's the kind of stretch that changes narratives. That's the kind of stretch that makes front offices in other cities start making phone calls.

Mike Paulson, who built the A's dynasty and is currently running the Chicago Bulls, was asked about the Warriors' interest in him as an executive. He declined to comment. Again.

The trade cost Golden State Moses Moody, Draymond Green, and four first-round picks. It's the kind of price you pay when you think the window's closing and you need to kick it back open with force. Giannis is thirty-one. Curry's thirty-eight. Butler's thirty-six. This isn't a rebuild. This is a championship or bust.

And right now, it looks like a championship.

The defense has been the surprise. Butler's guarding the best perimeter player every night. Giannis is erasing mistakes in the paint. The offense is scoring one hundred and eighteen points per game during the streak. The defense is holding opponents to one hundred and four.

Steph will start the All-Star Game. He'll run pick-and-rolls with Giannis for the first time in front of a national audience. The league will watch and wonder if this is sustainable.

Oakland already knows the answer.

THE BAYLIGHT VOTE IS THREE CYCLES AWAY. WHERE'S THE NOISE?

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist | Bay Tribune Sports

The Baylight District vote is three cycles away. The council will vote on the stadium initiative that could define Oakland sports for the next generation. And right now, the city feels quiet.

Too quiet.

I'm not talking about the lack of coverage. The Tribune's been all over it. Carmen Delaine's been tracking the council math for weeks. Anthony's been writing about the A's spring training like the stadium's already built. But where's the noise from the streets?

Where are the rallies? Where are the packed council chambers? Where are the signs in the windows and the arguments at the bars and the essays on neighborhood message boards?

The Temescal health center vote had more visible energy than this. West Oakland Stabilization Fund had people lining up to testify. But the Baylight District — the thing that's supposed to bring the A's home permanently, the thing that's supposed to anchor the waterfront and create jobs and prove Oakland can build something that lasts — it's getting treated like a procedural vote.

That bothers me.

Maybe it's because the environmental review's still underway. Maybe it's because people are tired of stadium promises that never materialize. Maybe it's because the city's been burned so many times by developers and franchise owners and politicians who said they cared about Oakland but really just cared about tax breaks.

I get it. I've lived here my whole life. I've watched teams leave. I've watched promises collapse. I've watched the city vote for hope and get handed receipts.

But this is different. This has to be different.

The A's are playing in Arizona this season. They're coming back in 2041. The Baylight District is supposed to be ready by then. The vote is three cycles away, and if it passes, construction starts. If it fails, we're back to square one.

Mark Aitken was at the Temescal vote. He didn't speak. He didn't have to. His presence said enough. He's the MLBPA rep now. He's got civic weight. He's the kind of player who shows up because he understands what votes mean.

But where's the noise from the rest of the city?

Three cycles. That's it. That's all the time we've got to make sure the council understands what's at stake.

The A's are off-season. The Warriors just landed Giannis and went on a five-game win streak. The Bulls are thirty-nine and sixteen with Paulson running the show in Chicago. Oakland sports are loud right now. But the Baylight vote? It's whisper-quiet.

That needs to change. Fast.

CHICAGO SPORTS

THE ROOKIE WHO NEEDS A LONGER LEASH — AND THE COACH WHO WON'T GIVE HIM ONE

By Selena Grant | Bulls Beat Reporter

Hank Trepagnier posted 27 points, 10 rebounds, and 3 blocks against Nikola Jokic Saturday night. He outplayed the two-time MVP on both ends of the floor. And when Billy Donovan addressed reporters after the Bulls' 108-100 win over Denver — a statement victory that pushed Chicago to 39-16, the best record in the Eastern Conference — the first thing the head coach mentioned was Trepagnier's transition defense.

Not the scoring. Not the rebounding. Not the way the 19-year-old rookie ran the floor like a gazelle and finished through contact. The celebrating. The fist-pumping. The delay in getting back on defense.

"He's got to grow up," Donovan said, measured but firm. "You make a great play, you get back. We can't have a guy who leads the Rookie of the Year race acting like he just won the championship every time he scores."

The numbers suggest Trepagnier has little to apologize for. He is averaging 16.9 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists over a season in which he has been asked to anchor the middle for a legitimate contender. He was named the starting center for the World team in Friday's Rising Stars game. No first-year player since Tim Duncan has carried this kind of offensive and defensive load while maintaining this level of efficiency.

Josh Giddey, meanwhile, is averaging 18.7 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists and did not make the All-Star team. His 34-point, 17-assist, 10-rebound triple-double against Denver was the kind of performance that used to earn standing ovations. Instead, it earned a footnote in a week when the All-Star snubs were announced and Chicago's lead guard found himself on the outside looking in.

Mike Paulson, speaking briefly before the game, did not address Giddey's exclusion directly. But the subtext was clear: "We're not building for February," he said. "We're building for June."

The roster now reflects that strategy. Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons — the deadline acquisitions that dominated last cycle's coverage — have settled into the rotation alongside Giddey, Trepagnier, Matas Buzelis, and Walker Kessler. The Bulls are twelve deep with postseason experience layered over a young core that is learning how to win on the fly.

And then there is Ayo Dosunmu, who re-signed this week on a three-year, $16.88 million deal that locks in one of the most underrated two-way guards in the league. Dosunmu is Chicago-born, Chicago-raised, and has quietly become the steadiest hand in a locker room full of stars and future stars.

Adash Stanley, the second rookie who earned a Rising Stars selection as the sixth man off the bench, has absorbed every minute of reserve point guard duty with the same quiet efficiency.

The All-Star break arrives in days. Chicago will send two players to Rising Stars and zero to the main event. Giddey's snub will sting. What matters now is that the Bulls sit atop the East with a coach who refuses to let his best young player think he has arrived.

"Win a championship," Donovan said. "Then we'll all celebrate."

Trepagnier, to his credit, nodded when the quote was relayed to him in the hallway. He did not argue. He just smiled — briefly — and walked back inside.

CHICAGO GROUND

EIGHTY-ONE DEGREES IN JULY, BULLS AT 39-16, AND THE CITY REMEMBERS WHAT SUMMER USED TO FEEL LIKE

By Talia Finch | Chicago Ground Reporter

The hydrants were running on Halsted again. Not because anything was broken. Because the city opened them. Because it was 81 degrees and clear and because this is what Chicago does in July when the weather cooperates and the Bulls are winning and there is no reason to be anywhere except outside.

The kids on the South Side had been spinning through the spray since noon, their sneakers soaked through, their T-shirts clinging to their backs. On a stoop three doors down, a woman in a Bulls jersey — Trepagnier's number — was fanning herself with a folded Tribune while listening to the postgame call-in show on her phone.

This is the texture of a city in mid-season when the wins keep stacking and the summer heat refuses to break. Lincoln Park had its runners. Pilsen had its sidewalk cafes. Bronzeville had its porch conversations that stretched from the afternoon into the evening, voices overlapping about Trepagnier's performance against Jokic, about whether Ayo's extension was enough money, about what Paulson's plan really is when the Warriors keep circling him like sharks.

At a corner tap in Bridgeport, the kind of place where the regulars have assigned stools and the new faces get sized up before they order, the bartender had the Rising Stars announcement pulled up on his phone. Trepagnier starting for the World. Adash Stanley coming off the bench. Two rookies. Two Chicago kids now, even if only one was born here.

"Used to be we'd send one guy to the All-Star Game and feel like we made it," said a man at the end of the bar. "Now we got two in Rising Stars and we're mad Giddey didn't make the cut. That's a different problem."

The woman next to him laughed. "That's a championship problem."

Downtown, where the United Center casts its shadow over Madison Street and the restaurants have started staying open later on game nights, there was a different mood. Not louder. Not quieter. Just more certain. The Bulls are 39-16. The kind of record that makes a city start thinking about June instead of February.

The season is not over. The All-Star break has not even arrived. But the summer is here, the Bulls are winning, and Chicago is doing what it does best: living in the moment while quietly, carefully, beginning to believe in what comes next.

Names Index: Hank Trepagnier (C — ROY leader), Josh Giddey (PG), Ayo Dosunmu (Guard), Adash Stanley (PG — Rookie, Rising Stars), Mike Paulson (GM — Bulls/A's), Talia Finch (Chicago Ground Reporter)

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

Dear Editor,

The Temescal Health Center passed 6-2. I watched the vote online from my apartment on Telegraph. When Councilmember Vega said yes, when Councilmember Tran said yes, I cried. I actually cried. My daughter has diabetes. She is eight years old. Right now, if her blood sugar crashes at school, we are twenty minutes from the nearest clinic that takes our insurance. Twenty minutes in Oakland traffic can mean forty-five. Do you know what it is like to watch the clock and wonder if your kid is okay?

This health center is not politics to me. It is not a budget line. It is the difference between panic and being able to breathe. People talk about fiscal responsibility like it is the only thing that matters. What about responsibility to the people who live here? The people who cannot afford to drive to Emeryville or wait two hours at Highland?

I do not care what the CRC thinks. I do not care about coalition discipline. I care that my daughter will have somewhere to go when she needs help. Thank you, Councilmember Vega. Thank you, Councilmember Tran. You just changed my life.

— Sofia Martinez, 34, Temescal

Dear Editor,

I have been following the Bulls all season from my couch in Fruitvale. My cousin lives in Chicago, sends me updates, and we text during every game. Thirty-nine wins and sixteen losses. Let that sink in. The best record in the East. Mike Paulson built that. The same Mike Paulson who built our A's dynasty is doing it again in Chicago, and now the Warriors want him too?

Look, I get it. Paulson is a genius. But the man is human. He cannot be in three cities at once. I watched Danny Horn and Vinnie Keane play wiffleball in Temescal during SummerFestival last week. Horn lives here. Keane lives here. This is their city. They need a GM who is present, not someone boarding planes every other day.

The Warriors just got Giannis. They are swinging for the fences. Fine. But leave Paulson alone. Let him finish what he started in Oakland and Chicago. We do not need to be greedy. We need to be smart.

— Carlos Ruiz, 29, Fruitvale

Dear Editor,

Forty-five days. That is what the city said when the Stabilization Fund passed. The money would start moving in forty-five days. Well, we are halfway through that window and I have not seen a single application form. I have not seen a single flyer. I have not seen anyone from the city administrator's office walking these blocks explaining how this is supposed to work.

I own a barbershop on Seventh Street. I have been here for twelve years. My rent went up twice in the last three years. The fund is supposed to help with that. But how? Who do I call? Where do I go? The council votes, the cameras show up, and then everyone goes home. Meanwhile, I am sitting here wondering if I am supposed to just wait for someone to knock on my door and hand me a check.

I am not saying the fund is a scam. I am saying implementation matters as much as passage. West Oakland has been promised a lot of things over the years. We are still waiting on most of them. I hope this one is different. But hope does not pay rent.

— Terrell Washington, 51, West Oakland

Dear Editor,

My mosque, the Islamic Center of Oakland, held a grief gathering this past week. We opened our doors to anyone who needed a place to sit, to talk, to be with others. People came. Different faiths, different backgrounds, all carrying something heavy. That is what SummerFestival means to me. Not just the block parties and the music. The part where we show up for each other when things are hard.

St. Columba activated their emergency assistance fund in Fruitvale. Allen Temple ran a health fair in East Oakland. The Cathedral held their food pantry. Acts Full Gospel served lunch to seniors in West Oakland. Every tradition, every neighborhood, doing the same work in different ways. Feeding people. Helping people. Being present.

I hear a lot of talk about Oakland being divided. About factions and coalitions and who voted which way on what measure. But I also see the mosques and churches and synagogues and temples doing the work that never makes the front page. We are not waiting for the city to save us. We are saving each other. That is the Oakland I know.

— Amina Hassan, 42, Temescal
