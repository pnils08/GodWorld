Mark Aitken — “Charity is a system, not a selfie”

P Slayer: Big gala tonight. Lights, donors, speeches. Why you?
Mark: Because I keep receipts. If a kid swings a bat at camp, I want to see what changed by winter break.
P Slayer: Metrics for kindness—cold or clean?
Mark: Clean. Charity without follow‑through is theater. We build reps, not moments.
P Slayer: You are known as The Iron Corner. Where’s the softness?
Mark: In the plan. You design durable things so people can rest.
P Slayer: One line to the kid in the back who thinks talent skipped him.
Mark: Talent did not skip you. Consistency has your name on it. Go sign for it.
