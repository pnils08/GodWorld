PITCHING REPERTOIRE

Slider — 82 mph
• His best pitch
• Advanced shape for a 19-year-old
• True wipeout potential if velo climbs

Cutter — 88 mph
• Shockingly mature velocity for a teenage LHP
• Early signs of plus development
• Used as his “get me back in the count” pitch

Sinker — 85 mph
• Plays well because his break rating (BRK 65) boosts late action
• Groundball generator candidate

Changeup — 81 mph
• Still very raw
• Key for his long-term ceiling
• Could become a legitimate MLB weapon

Summary:
Four pitches at age 19 is insane.
This is what an A-Potential lefty foundation looks like.

STATCAST-STYLE METRICS (PROJECTED)

Velocity Band:
4-seam projection (future): 91–94 mph
Cutter projection: 89–92 mph
Slider projection: 83–86 mph

Whiff Profile:
Currently low (K/9 41), but…
His slider & cutter project massive growth once his command stabilizes.

Contact Quality Against (projected):
H/9: Needs improvement
HR/9: Solid foundation
BB/9: Wild now, fixable later

Command Projection:
CTRL 51 → Future 60+ potential
This matches most high-level pitching prospects at age 19.

⸻

RUN PREVENTION OUTLOOK (SIM-BASED)

ERA projection (peak MLB): 3.50–3.90
ERA projection (early MLB): 4.20–4.60
Inning Pattern: 5–6 IP ceiling
Role Probability:
• SP2/SP3 if everything hits
• SP4 if command lags
• RP weapon if only slider/cutter develop

This is a slow-burn rotation project —
but one with serious upside.

⸻

DEFENSE & ATHLETICS

Fielding: 44
Arm Strength: 61
Arm Accuracy: 53
Reaction: 28 (very low)

He’s a pitcher, not a defender.
All of this is normal for a teenage arm.

⸻

DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY

Big picture:

• 19 years old
• A-Potential
• Multi-year runway
• Already showing elite break (BRK 65)
• Cutter velocity suggests natural strength

This is the pitching version of a first-round “project” who becomes a monster at age 23–24.

Key Development Needs:
• Miss-generation
• Strike throwing
• Command shaping
• Consistency

If the changeup clicks?
He becomes a borderline ace.

⸻

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Break rating (65) at age 19 is absurd — pitch shaping department loves him.
• Slider/cutter combo could become elite if velocity ticks up.
• Sinker quality disguises lack of raw fastball velocity.
• He is nowhere near MLB-ready — and that’s fine.
• Oakland should slow-play him through A+, AA.

“He’s a long-term play with real return.”

⸻

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“He’s a kid with a grown man’s slider.
Yeah, he’s wild — that’s what makes him fun.
Give him two years and hitters are gonna HATE facing this dude.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Left-handed pitching prospects with early feel for four pitches often become the quiet pillars of future rotations.
Lopez is far from finished, but his foundation echoes some of the great developmental stories of baseball.”
