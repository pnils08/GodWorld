- [As_Universe] Athletics 2040 Offseason Chronicle
Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents
balance between legacy and reinvent.txt

- [As_Universe] Athletics 2040 Offseason Chronicle
Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents
balance between legacy and reinvent.txt

- [As_Universe] Athletics 2040 Offseason Chronicle
Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents
balance between legacy and reinvent.txt

Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents
balance between legacy and reinvent.txt

Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents

Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,

Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents

- [As_Universe] Athletics 2040 Offseason Chronicle
Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents
balance between legacy and reinvent.txt

Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents

- [As_Universe] 2040 OFFSEASON: BENJI DILLON RETURNS TO OAKLAND
- [As_Universe] Athletics 2040 Offseason Chronicle
Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents

Phase I – Turning the Page
On November 20, 2040, the Athletics traded SP John Brever (31) and CP William Tata (27) to the
Rangers for 19-year-old SP Clemente Lopez (A potential) and 18-year-old CF Robby Boston. The
move cleared $24.1M in salary and marked the beginning of a youth-centric retooling.
Phase II – The Return of the Golden Arm
Benji Dillon re-signed for 1 year, $24.07M. His quote, “Holy Toledo! I'm signing with the Athletics!”
echoed through the Bay. Dillon's return reaffirmed the heart of the rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Lopez,
Dillon, Ellis.
Phase III – The Rebuild and the Ripple
The Athletics executed a series of strategic trades — Porcelli for Calzado, Carter and Miller for Cross,
and William/Mullins/Marquez for Veras. Louis Cross, a 29-year-old reliever with a 2.13 ERA in 2039,
headlines the bullpen transformation.
Phase IV – National Spotlight
National coverage called the Brever trade a “payroll cleanse and youth reset.” Headlines praised GM
Mike Kinder’s “payroll judo” as Oakland reshaped its bullpen and core identity for the 2040s.
Summary Insight
By spring 2040, Oakland had shed over $40M in contracts, added five controllable arms under 30, and
brought back Dillon as the cornerstone. The offseason theme — “Rebuild with Rhythm” — represents
balance between legacy and reinvent.txt
