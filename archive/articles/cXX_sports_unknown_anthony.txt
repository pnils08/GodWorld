Section 1 – Overview

The 2040 control sheet represents the most delicate fiscal balance the Oakland franchise has attempted in over a decade.
Projected payroll for Opening Day stands at $136,000,000, nearly identical to 2039, but now heavily backloaded across three veterans: John Brever ($24,100,000), Benji Dillon (pending $19,200,000 offer), and Vinnie Keane ($15,000,000 projected incentive package).

Franchise economists anticipate $162,000,000 in total salary commitments once arbitration and depth contracts finalize — a figure that mirrors late-dynasty pacing but without corresponding gate revenue.

Section 2 – Rotation and WAR Outlook
Pitcher	Age	2039 WAR	2040 Projected WAR	Contract Status
Benji Dillon	36	3.3	2.7	FA – Offer Pending
John Brever	31	2.4	1.5	Signed thru 2041 ($24.1M AAV)
John Ellis	23	—	1.8	Under Team Control
TBD (Free Agent Target)	29–32	—	3.0	

Aggregate rotation WAR projection: ~9.0 (down from 11.2 in 2039).
Analytics stress “innings durability” as the primary scouting filter, a departure from the power metrics that defined the dynasty’s earlier builds.

Section 3 – Positional Core Metrics
Player	Role	2039 OPS	Notes
Vinnie Keane	3B	1.064	Elite contact retention despite injury downtime
Mark Aitken	1B/3B	.466 SLG	“Iron Corner” consistency steady
Darrin Davis	CF	.276 AVG	Still a defensive anchor
Isley Kelley	SS	.319 OBP	Aging but stabilizing influence

Front office analysis positions this quartet as Tier-1 Continuity Assets under the current roster model.

Section 4 – Management Notes

Manager Mike Kinder enters the final year of his contract (expires 2040). The organization has expressed intent to review performance metrics mid-season before any extension discussion.
Executive sentiment suggests “evaluation of succession pathways,” implying long-term restructuring may be imminent.

Section 5 – Projection Summary
Category	2039 Actual	2040 Forecast
Team WAR	41.5	38.2
Payroll	$135.7M	$162M
Postseason Odds	61%	48%
Average Attendance	29,800	26,400 (est.)
Closing Notes

2040 marks the organization’s transition from legacy maintenance to structural audit.
If Dillon returns and Ellis develops as projected, the A’s may maintain competitive posture — but the dynasty, as defined, is living on borrowed time.
