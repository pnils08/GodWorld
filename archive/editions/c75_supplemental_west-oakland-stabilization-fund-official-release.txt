STABILIZATION FUND TARGETS MIGRATION CRISIS; COUNCIL VOTE IN CYCLE 76

Reserve fund draw requires supermajority one cycle after new members seated

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

OAKLAND — Hours after confirming six new council members, Mayor Avery Santana’s office released the full proposal for a $28 million emergency intervention in West Oakland, setting up a supermajority vote that will test the newly restored council immediately.

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund, labeled an “emergency economic intervention,” aims to slow the migration outflow that has devastated the neighborhood. The proposal requires a 6-3 supermajority for the $12 million reserve fund draw at its core — meaning at least one vote beyond OPP’s four-seat bloc.

The vote is scheduled for Cycle 76. The council was seated hours ago.

“West Oakland is not waiting for Baylight,” the proposal states. “The moving trucks are running now. The storefronts are dark now.”

**THE NUMBERS**

The fund documents West Oakland’s collapse in stark terms:

|Indicator                          |Cycle 60|Cycle 73|Change|
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|------|
|Migration Drift                    |-12     |-45     |-275% |
|Vacant Storefronts (7th Street)    |8       |23      |+188% |
|Small Business Closures (quarterly)|6       |14      |+133% |
|Residential Vacancy Rate           |4.2%    |9.1%    |+117% |

The proposal notes that declining rents — down 10% to $2,150 for a two-bedroom — reflect “collapsed demand,” not affordability improvement. “People leaving faster than prices can attract replacements.”

**FINANCING**

|Source             |Amount|Mechanism                         |
|-------------------|------|----------------------------------|
|City Reserve Fund  |$12M  |Emergency appropriation (6-3 vote)|
|Alameda County ARPA|$8M   |Intergovernmental transfer        |
|Port of Oakland    |$5M   |Existing partnership              |
|Private Foundations|$3M   |Committed pending city action     |

**Total:** $28M over 24 months

**THE PROGRAMS**

The fund creates five intervention tracks:

**Small Landlord Retention Grants ($8M):** Up to $25,000 for owner-occupied 2-4 unit buildings. Requires commitment to maintain tenants, cap rent increases at 3% for 24 months. Target: 400 properties.

**Commercial Rent Relief ($7M):** Up to $36,000 for businesses operating 2+ years, $24,000 for new businesses opening in vacant storefronts. Requires 24-month lease, local hiring preference. Target: 250 businesses.

**Longtime Resident Stability Grants ($6M):** Up to $8,000 for households under 80% AMI with 5+ years residency; up to $12,000 for seniors on fixed income with 10+ years. Can cover back rent, moving prevention, emergency repairs. Target: 800 households.

**Storefront Activation ($4M):** Pop-up subsidies, community space conversions, public art, façade improvements. Target: 60 storefronts activated.

**Emergency Small Business Loans ($3M revolving):** $10,000-$75,000 at 2% fixed, 36-60 month repayment, 6-month grace period. No collateral under $30,000. Target: 50-75 loans.

**THE VOTE**

Six votes are required. OPP holds four seats (Rivers, Carter, Delgado, Mobley).

The proposal needs two additional votes from: Ramon Vega (IND), Leonard Tran (IND), Warren Ashford (CRC), Nina Chen (CRC), or Elliott Crane (CRC, participating remotely).

Councilmember Denise Carter (D1-OPP), whose district is West Oakland, is expected to champion the proposal. She was seated hours ago.

City Planning Director Mara Vance confirmed the expedited timeline: “Budget & Finance Committee review is underway. The full council vote proceeds in Cycle 76.”

The proposal acknowledges its own limitations: “This is not a solution. It’s a tourniquet.”

ANALYSIS
############################################################

THE MATH: WHERE DO SIX VOTES COME FROM?

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

The Stabilization Fund needs 6-3. Here’s the count:

**LIKELY YES (4 votes)**

**Janae Rivers (D5-OPP):** Progressive Caucus Leader. West Oakland stabilization aligns with OPP priorities. Yes.

**Denise Carter (D1-OPP):** Represents West Oakland directly. Her entire platform was displacement prevention. Yes.

**Rose Delgado (D3-OPP):** Fruitvale representative, but OPP bloc discipline expected. Yes.

**Terrence Mobley (D9-OPP):** Tenant protection organizer before appointment. Yes.

**THE SWING VOTES (need 2 of 5)**

**Ramon Vega (D4-IND, Council President):** Pragmatic centrist. Has supported emergency measures before but guards reserve fund carefully. Could go either way. His vote may depend on whether he sees this as genuine emergency or policy spending.

**Leonard Tran (D2-IND):** Planning Commission background, small business owner. The commercial rent relief and small business loan programs might appeal to him. Unknown position.

**LIKELY NO (3 votes)**

**Warren Ashford (D7-CRC):** Has criticized “regulatory overreach” and government intervention in markets. The proposal’s explicit framing as a “tourniquet” against market forces is exactly what he opposes. Likely no.

**Nina Chen (D8-CRC):** Fiscal analyst background. Concerned about cumulative impact of multiple large initiatives. The reserve fund draw for a “holding action” may not meet her standard for emergency spending. Likely no.

**Elliott Crane (D6-CRC):** Business Caucus Leader, participating remotely. Even if inclined to consider it, CRC discipline and his fiscal conservatism suggest no. But his health situation adds uncertainty.

**THE PATH TO SIX**

OPP’s four plus both independents (Vega and Tran) gets to six. This is the most plausible path.

Alternatively: OPP’s four plus one independent plus Crane breaking from CRC. Less likely but possible if Crane’s remote status gives him political cover.

The proposal acknowledges the tension: “The $12M reserve fund draw is the sticking point. Reserves exist for emergencies — but is a migration crisis an ‘emergency’ in the budgetary sense?”

That question will be answered in Cycle 76.

THE TIMELINE: WHY SO FAST?

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

Standard appropriations take 8-10 cycles. The Stabilization Fund compresses to 4-5:

|Phase                            |Timing  |
|---------------------------------|--------|
|Emergency Proposal Introduction  |Cycle 74|
|Budget & Finance Committee Review|Cycle 75|
|Full Council Vote                |Cycle 76|
|County ARPA Transfer Request     |Cycle 77|
|Fund Launch                      |Cycle 78|

The expedited timeline reflects the proposal’s core argument: West Oakland doesn’t have time.

“Baylight District breaks ground in Year 3,” the document states. “That’s 18+ months away. West Oakland may not have 18 months.”

The proposal frames itself as a bridge — 24 months of stabilization until Baylight construction employment provides “organic economic stimulus.” If the fund launches in Cycle 78 and runs 24 months, it expires roughly when Baylight construction peaks.

Critics will note that the expedited timeline gives the newly seated council almost no time to study a $28 million proposal before voting. Councilmembers Carter, Tran, Delgado, Ashford, Chen, and Mobley were confirmed hours ago. They vote on a supermajority reserve fund draw next cycle.

“This is how you get bad policy,” one budget observer said. “You rush people into votes before they’ve read the documents.”

The Mayor’s office response: “The documents have been public for cycles. The emergency has been visible for longer. The only thing that was missing was a council that could vote.”

Now there’s a council. Now there’s a vote.

WEST OAKLAND REACTS TO STABILIZATION FUND RELEASE

Residents respond to $28M emergency proposal

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Investigations

WEST OAKLAND — News of the Stabilization Fund’s official release spread quickly through the neighborhood Thursday evening. Reactions ranged from cautious hope to deep skepticism.

**“Finally, something for us”**

Darius Clark, 40, a bakery worker who has lived in West Oakland for twelve years, learned about the fund from a neighbor.

“I saw the numbers,” Clark said. “Migration drift, vacancy rates, all of it. Those aren’t just numbers. That’s my block. That’s the empty storefront next to where I work. That’s my landlord talking about selling.”

Clark said he might qualify for the longtime resident stability grant. “Eight thousand dollars won’t change everything. But it might change whether I’m still here in two years.”

**“I’ll believe it when I see it”**

Marcus Wright, 29, a server who wrote a letter to the Pulse about the Stabilization Fund earlier today, was less optimistic.

“Six votes,” Wright said. “They need six votes. They have four OPP. That means they need Vega and Tran, or they need a miracle.”

Wright said he’s watched promises to West Oakland before. “People love to talk about what they’re going to do for us. Then the vote fails, or the money runs out, or the program gets cut. I’ve been here long enough to know the pattern.”

**“This is a landlord bailout”**

Javier Harris, 57, an electrician and longtime renter, was sharply critical.

“Eight million dollars to landlords,” Harris said. “They call it ‘retention grants’ but it’s money going to property owners. My landlord doesn’t need a grant. He needs to fix the plumbing.”

Harris acknowledged the tenant protection requirements — landlords who raise rents or evict lose funding and face clawback — but remained skeptical. “Who’s going to enforce that? The city? When has the city ever enforced anything in West Oakland?”

**“We need this yesterday”**

Joel Roberts, 22, a plumber who moved to West Oakland two years ago, supported the fund despite its imperfections.

“Is it perfect? No. Is it enough? No. But it’s something,” Roberts said. “The alternative is nothing. The alternative is watching everyone leave while we wait for Baylight to maybe happen in three years.”

Roberts said the storefront activation program interested him most. “7th Street looks like a ghost town. If they can get some of those spaces open again, put some pop-ups in there, at least it looks like a neighborhood again.”

**“Why not Fruitvale?”**

The proposal anticipates criticism from other neighborhoods. Rafael Phillips, 26, a server in Fruitvale, voiced exactly that concern.

“West Oakland’s numbers are worst, I get it,” Phillips said. “But Fruitvale is hurting too. We just got Rose Delgado on council. Is she going to vote for $28 million to West Oakland while Fruitvale gets nothing?”

The proposal’s response: “Triage means treating the most acute case first.” Whether Fruitvale residents accept that framing remains to be seen.

OPINION
############################################################

A TOURNIQUET IS NOT A CURE

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports — Senior Historian

The Stabilization Fund proposal uses a striking metaphor: it’s a “tourniquet.”

The document is honest about this. It’s not a solution. It’s not a fix. It’s an attempt to slow the bleeding long enough for something else — Baylight, presumably — to arrive and provide real economic stimulus.

There’s something admirable about that honesty. Most government proposals promise transformation. This one promises survival.

But tourniquets have limitations. They’re emergency measures, not treatments. They stop bleeding by cutting off circulation. They buy time, but they don’t heal anything.

The Stabilization Fund asks Oakland to spend $28 million over 24 months to hold West Oakland together until Baylight construction begins. If Baylight happens on schedule. If construction employment materializes as projected. If the 8,500 jobs actually go to Oakland residents. If the economic benefits actually reach West Oakland rather than concentrating elsewhere.

That’s a lot of “ifs” for a $28 million bet.

I’m not saying the fund is wrong. West Oakland’s numbers are genuinely catastrophic. The migration drift, the vacancy rates, the storefront closures — these are real emergencies affecting real people. Something has to be done.

But we should be clear about what we’re doing. We’re buying time. We’re hoping the cavalry arrives. We’re applying a tourniquet and praying the ambulance shows up before we have to remove it.

The vote is Cycle 76. The council was seated today. Six members will decide whether West Oakland gets its tourniquet.

I hope they understand what they’re voting for. And what happens if it doesn’t work.

THE VOTE THAT WILL DEFINE THEM

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

Denise Carter has been on the Oakland City Council for approximately six hours.

In Cycle 76, she will vote on a $28 million emergency fund for her district. The district she was appointed to represent. The neighborhood where she spent eight years at the Community Development Corporation fighting displacement.

This is why she’s here. This is the vote.

I don’t know if the Stabilization Fund is good policy. I don’t know if $28 million over 24 months can actually hold West Oakland together. I don’t know if the programs are designed well or if the oversight is sufficient or if the money will reach the people who need it.

What I know is that my neighborhood is emptying. I know the storefronts are dark. I know the migration numbers. I know that people I’ve lived next to for years are gone, and new people aren’t replacing them.

Denise Carter knows this too. She’s been fighting it longer than I have.

So here’s what I want from my new councilmember: I want her to fight like this is the only vote that matters. Because for West Oakland, it might be.

Four OPP votes are locked. We need two more. That means convincing Ramon Vega or Leonard Tran that a migration crisis counts as an emergency. That means making the case that reserve funds exist for moments exactly like this one.

Councilmember Carter, you’ve been on the job for six hours. Welcome to the work.
