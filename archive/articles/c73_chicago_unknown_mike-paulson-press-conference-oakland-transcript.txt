MIKE PAULSON PRESS CONFERENCE — OAKLAND(Transcript)
Post-Cycle 73.txt 
| A’s Spring Training Media Availability
Location: Oakland Athletics Media Room

Paulson steps to the podium. First time on an Oakland stage since the walkout. The room is smaller than Chicago — no national cameras, no basketball buzz. Just the beat writers who’ve been waiting.

Anthony, Bay Tribune Sports — Lead A’s Beat:
“Mike, welcome back. Last time you stood at an Oakland podium, you walked out. You addressed it from Chicago, but this is the first time you’re facing this room directly. What do you want to say to Oakland — not about basketball, not about the stadium — about what happened?”

I’d like to address this off the bat and just express my regret on how I reacted to the situation.  I acted poorly in the moment and Oakland citizens certainly deserve more than that.  I shouldn’t have made predictions on the health crisis and been overly enthusiastic about an end to it. The line of questioning turned to how I knew this when I should’ve just kept my support to the medical community and not minimizing the situation with a prediction

Anthony nods, scribbles notes. The room is quiet. A few beats pass before the next question.

Anthony, Bay Tribune Sports — Follow-up:
“Appreciated. Moving to baseball — Deacon Seymour has never managed a professional game. You praised him from Chicago, but you haven’t been in Mesa. Spring training opens against San Diego. Will you be there for his first game, and what’s your honest assessment of where he is as a first-year manager?”

Yeah , I’ll just tell you I’m a huge fan of Deacon . I understand the concerns but I’m confident in his abilities. I couple that with having a young nucleus that’s ready to win . I’m  encourage this will be the case . Also , it’s untrue to suggest I gar not been to Mesa.  I am able to manage my time effectively to be in Mesa 3 days a week and Chicago 3 days a week. Of course my office is with me 7 days. Time will tell on that story and I understand the concerns. We are taking all precautions to ensure success

Anthony raises an eyebrow at the Mesa correction, makes a note. A few reporters exchange glances — that travel schedule hasn’t been reported.

Hal Richmond, Bay Tribune Sports — Senior Historian:
“Mike, this roster on paper might be the most talented you’ve ever assembled. Rivas, Coles, Davis coming back, Keane’s final year, Dillon returning. But the ALCS loss to Boston exposed depth concerns when injuries hit. What’s different about 2041 that makes you believe this group gets over the hump?”

I’d agree with that assessment and specifically I’d point to pitching depth . We played too may games these past playoffs where the offense was carrying the load . A lot 8 to 9 run games. If we limit some of those the 7 we score looks alot better . That’s why we took some big swings this offseason adding a second Ace having a very productive Dillon take the 5 spot in the rotation. Take a swing a young hot shot closer while also adding a top 20 pitching prospect.  The truth of the matter is we have more depth in the farm than the roster. This offseason we escalated a few positions is all . The bullpen is uber talented so we just have to get the mix set even if that means making moves in season

Hal nods approvingly — the old historian appreciates a GM who talks pitching depth. P Slayer leans forward in his seat.

P Slayer, Fan Columnist:
“Mike. Six World Series rings. NBA Cup trophy. Stadium deal that doesn’t cost taxpayers a dime. You’re splitting time between two cities, two sports, two franchises. I wrote a column asking what you actually want at this point. So I’m asking you directly: What’s the thing that gets you out of bed? What are you chasing?”

P , I’m surprised you’re letting me off the hook on the health crisis fiasco . I know I walked out on your questioning and honestly I’m most ashamed of that . You are the heart of the cities passion and I didnt honor that . I sincerely apologize.  I’m chasing greatest each day . That may sound cheesy but it’s a true statement. Specifically I want to make a positive impact on people I interact with and on a larger scale impact on the cities I’m working with. I see the impact successful sports or just business can have on a society . It’s why i overstepped on the health crisis. I got a bit over excited about my belief in these medical comm unities but learned a valuable lesson of the damage I can do as well

P Slayer sits back. The room is silent for a moment — nobody expected Paulson to go there unprompted. P Slayer gives a small nod, something unreadable crossing his face. He doesn’t follow up.

Carmen Delaine, Bay Tribune Civic:
“The Baylight District agreement is the biggest stadium news Oakland’s had in years. But Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei — your lead negotiator on this — has been hospitalized since Cycle 72. No updates on his condition. Can you speak to how this deal came together, who stepped in, and whether you have any information on Osei’s status?”

We always saw Oakland as home. When the LasVegas deal fell through we were pleased to be able to play in Arizona Diamondbacks stadium but now we are ready to take Oakland back . I have to admit the Mayor has been a huge advocate for the project and lesser known hero on this is Mark Aitken. I will tell you Mark is a future politician. The fans and citizens of Oakland wanting it is probably the biggest reason.  Marcus is a very close friend and news has been scarce on his situation but I’ve been in contact and he wanted me to share an update . Marcus was in a traffic collision and has been hospitalized for a few cycles now. He’s on the mend and doing some recovery . That’s about all I can share right now

Carmen’s pen stops. That’s the first public confirmation of what happened to Osei. Reporters are already texting editors. She presses forward.

Carmen Delaine, Bay Tribune Civic — Follow-up:
“Thank you for that update — I know the city’s been wondering. One more on Baylight: the plan goes to the City Planning Committee next. You’re asking for tax exemptions rather than public funding. What happens if the committee says no? Is there a backup plan, or is this the only path back to Oakland?”

I’m glad to be able to share the update and will say Osei is a tough one and he already is trying to work and serve the community.  We feel the tax plan is fair and we are not looking for a set rate . We believe this plan is more inline with the city success than the e franchise.

Carmen nods, finishes her notes. The Osei news will lead tonight — but there’s more ground to cover.

Luis Navarro, Bay Tribune Investigations:
“Mike, migration drift hit -45 this cycle. Worst reading we’ve tracked. West Oakland is emptying out — storefronts dark, families leaving. You’re promising a stadium, but that’s years away. People are leaving now. What’s your message to residents who feel like the city is being left behind while the focus is on deals and championships elsewhere?”

Unfortunately I don’t think I’m the best situated to speak on that but I’d say that a stadium may be a couple years away but the jobs are not . As soon as we are able shovels are hitting dirt , stimulation starts

Luis writes it down but doesn’t look satisfied. He lets it go — for now.

Mags Corliss, Bay Tribune Sports — Managing Editor:
“Mike, Vinnie Keane announced this is his final season. The man’s been here a decade, six championships, face of the franchise. How involved will you be in making sure his farewell gets the send-off it deserves? And has there been any conversation about what comes next for him — coaching, front office, anything to keep him in Oakland green and gold?”

Vinnie is a man of many fames as we all know so he most definitely will have all his options available to him . I’m sure he could play a few more years if he wanted too. We’d love to have Vinnie here but may be too hard to keep him from the national media camera.  And yes this will be a season dedicated to Vinnie and we will also be doing some stuff for Benji .

Mags smiles slightly — she knows the Keane family well. The Benji mention catches a few ears.

Anthony, Bay Tribune Sports — Follow-up:
“You mentioned Benji. He just made the cover of Science Monthly for his water filtration work — second time on that cover. He’s 38, one-year deal, slotting into the five spot. Is this a farewell tour for Dillon too? And does he know that’s how the organization sees it?”

Benji is the smartest person I’ve spent this much time next too. He’s on a different level mentally haha. I wouldn’t call it a farewell but we will be honoring the Dynasty with Keane retirement so naturally Benji will be apart of that . We will also be bringing older players from those runs and honoring it all. The vision that’s clear to all we are showing the youth what the expectation is

Anthony nods — that’s a good quote. The dynasty celebration angle is new information.

P Slayer, Fan Columnist — Second question:
“You mentioned showing the youth the expectation. Danny Horn told us he thinks he’s the best player in baseball. Straight up said it. His numbers back it up — .280, 32 homers, 35 steals, 8.0 WAR. Do you agree with him? And how do you manage that kind of confidence in a clubhouse with veterans like Keane and Dillon?”

Horn is a perfectionist so it’s on par to make those claims as if he doesn’t believe it then it can’t be true. I do agree with Horn being the most talent athlete and all around best player in the league . We try to managing winning and winning backs down to no one

P Slayer grins — that’s the quote he wanted. A GM backing his player’s boldest claim.

Dr. Lila Mezran, Bay Tribune Health Desk:
“Mike, I have to ask. The health situation in Temescal is entering its fifth week. You addressed this crisis once before — by your own admission today, poorly. The community is now organizing mutual aid networks because official answers haven’t come. I’m not asking you to make predictions this time. I’m asking: as someone who employs people who live in these neighborhoods, who runs a franchise that depends on this city’s health — what is the A’s organization actually doing to support residents right now?”

As a resident of Oakland I too am concerned and focused on what I can do to help start getting some resolve and understanding. I think the part that has people worried is the unknown nature of the crisis. The medical community has done a brilliant job keeping the cases from escalating in severity. As an organization we will have players visiting local hospitals and clinics , we will be, we also will be running informative media spots featuring players to raise awareness. We stand by ready and willing to do our part as a Pilar if the community

Dr. Mezran writes carefully. It’s a measured answer — no predictions this time, concrete actions promised. She nods once.

Hal Richmond, Bay Tribune Sports — Final question:
“Mike, last one. Elliott Crane — Business Caucus Leader on the City Council — has also been out since Cycle 72. Listed as injured. You just gave us news on Osei. Any word on Crane? And more broadly: two civic officials down at the same time the city is trying to push through a major stadium deal. Does that concern you about the timeline?”

Unfortunately I don’t have any news on Elliot at this time but he can that we expect to have him back at work soon.  No not concerned as this has been in the works for sometime so the structure has been mostly in place. That said we would most definitely benefit from being at full strength but like our teams sometimes you have to make do with who’s available.

Hal nods — the “next man up” framing is pure Paulson.

Anthony, Bay Tribune Sports — Closing:
“Last question, Mike. You’re here. You apologized. You gave us news on Osei, updates on the roster, backed Danny Horn’s claim. But I have to ask the simple one: Are you back? Not three days a week in Mesa, not splitting time — are you back in Oakland? Is this home again?”

Oakland is home. This is where I plan to raise my family and retire someday.

The room holds for a moment. Paulson steps back from the podium. Cameras click. The beat writers are already heading for the doors, phones out, filing alerts.
