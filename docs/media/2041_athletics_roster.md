## Key Storylines for Coverage

### 1. Davis Redemption (LEAD STORY)
Darrin Davis hit .186 in 2039. He won MVP in 2040 (.293/38/107). Now at 33, he's moving to left field — a position where his 63 FLD rating will be tested — to make room for 24-year-old Ernesto Quintero. The two-time MVP is sacrificing his body and his position for the next generation. This is the biggest sports story of the cycle.

### 2. The Generational Handoff
Quintero, Coles, Taveras — three players under 25 joining a core that includes 33-year-olds (Davis, Aitken), 34-year-olds (Kelley), 37-year-olds (Keane), and a 39-year-old (Dillon). The dynasty's window is being held open by one hand while the other reaches for new blood. The tension between honoring the old guard and building the future runs through every roster decision.

### 3. The Cost of Travis Coles
Cy Newell struck out 11 in his debut and became a symbol. Agustin Rodriguez hit a clutch ALDS homer. Peter Busch went deep four times in the 2040 postseason. All three are gone, traded to Washington for a 21-year-old with a 2.05 ERA. P Slayer's fury was the fans' fury. The front office's answer is on the mound every five days.

### 4. Taveras — The $225M Question
Career .244 hitter. 93 OVR. Seven years, $32.1M per. P Slayer called him a waste. The game sees 94 power, A-potential, and a 25-year-old ceiling that hasn't been reached. This is the longest-term bet on the roster.

### 5. Keane's Farewell
61 OVR. 58 games in 2040. Six errors. But also: MVP 2031, 7x All-Star, 3x Gold Glove, franchise cornerstone. The body can't do what the spirit demands. Retirement ceremony planned. The green and gold says goodbye.

### 6. Dillon's Last Sunset
The 5x Cy Young winner is the 5th starter at 39. He reads one page of Science Monthly before every start. His wife Maya and son Rick Jr. watch from the same seats. The left hand that defined an era is throwing 75-OVR fastballs now. But 17-6 with a 3.55 ERA says the brain still outpitches the arm.

### 7. Richards the Invisible Star
6.8 WAR. Perfect fielding. .297 average. Zero dedicated articles in the entire Tribune archive. P Slayer's favorite player. This is a gap in our coverage that should embarrass us. Fix it this edition.

### 8. Aitken's Crossroads
Contract year. HR Derby winner. Son of a former mayor. Attending civic hearings. 94 OVR at first base. The most politically connected athlete on the roster is playing for his next contract and maybe something beyond baseball.

### 9. Kelley's Machine Winding Down
92.1 career WAR. 2563 hits. 468 home runs. The greatest shortstop in franchise history is 34 and a free agent after this season. Will Oakland re-sign him? Can they afford to? Can they afford not to?

### 10. Rosales Filling Pena's Shoes
Edmundo Pena was a decade of automatic ninth innings. Mariano Rosales is a 26-year-old power arm with 38 saves and 5 blown saves. The leash is short and the shadow is long.

## Position Corrections (Canon)

- **Darrin Davis:** LF for 2041 (was DH). Moved to accommodate Quintero. Defensive metrics poor (63 FLD, 61 ACC). DH is his natural fit but sacrifice is the story.
- **Ernesto Quintero:** DH for 2041 (was 3B/1B in minors). Gets at-bats without defensive exposure.
- **Eric Taveras:** 2B. NOT a utility player. Everyday starter.
- **Travis Coles:** Pitched 2040 for WASHINGTON (WSH), not Oakland. Trade happened offseason.
- **Mariano Rosales:** Pitched 2040 for BALTIMORE (BAL). Acquired offseason.
- **Cy Newell:** TRADED. No longer on the A's. Gone in the Coles deal with Rodriguez and Busch.
- **Benji Dillon:** LEFT-HANDED (L/L). Paulson ruling. This overrides any TrueSource that says R.

## Extended Roster (Not in Starting 9)

- **Vinnie Keane** — bench role, farewell tour, platoon DH/2B
- **Buford Park** — 3B depth (was mislabeled SP in ledger, corrected to 3B)
- **Allen Lopez** — SP (was mislabeled 2B in ledger, corrected to SP)
- **Paul Skenes** — SP, Tier 2 (game-era veteran, still on roster)
- **Orion Kerkering** — RP, Tier 2
- **Mason Miller** — RP, Tier 2 (retired in canon — should appear in farewell coverage per P Slayer index)
- **Vladimir Gonzalez** — RF starter, details TBD
- **Jose Colon** — C starter, details TBD
- **Arturo Ramos** — SP2, 90 OVR, details TBD
- **Dalton Rushing** — C, Retired
