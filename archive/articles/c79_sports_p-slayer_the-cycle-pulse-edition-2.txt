EARTHQUAKE ON THE BAY: WARRIORS LAND GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO IN BLOCKBUSTER TRADE

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist | Bay Tribune Sports

I was standing in my kitchen on 98th Avenue when the phone buzzed. Then it buzzed again. Then the group chat went nuclear.

Giannis Antetokounmpo is a Golden State Warrior.

Let that sit in your chest for a second. Let it do what it did to me — which is make a grown man who has watched this franchise through five decades of heartbreak and glory grip the edge of his counter and say, out loud, to nobody: "They actually did it."

Milwaukee sends Giannis and Jericho Sims to the Warriors. Golden State ships Draymond Green to Boston, Moses Moody and four first-round picks to the Bucks. Boston sends Anfernee Simmons and a first-rounder for Draymond Green. A three-team earthquake that reshapes the conference.

The Warriors sit at 28-24. Not bad. Not great. The kind of record that whispers "treadmill" to the analytics crowd, the kind of record that makes front offices stare at the ceiling at 2 a.m. wondering if they should blow it up or bet the house.

They bet the house. They bet the neighborhood. They bet the whole damn city.

And here is what I need you to understand about what this means in Oakland — not in the abstract, not as a cap sheet exercise, but in the real, living, breathing city that wears its sports franchises like armor. We have carried the noise through championships and through relocations. We have watched teams leave. We have watched teams threaten to leave. We have held on when holding on made no rational sense because that is what this city does. We grip tighter.

Now the Warriors hand us Giannis — a 7-foot force of nature, a two-time MVP, a man who once told Milwaukee he would never leave and then, like so many promises in professional sports, watched that vow dissolve under the weight of losing seasons and front-office drift. He comes to the Bay at 31, still in his prime window, still capable of things on a basketball court that defy physics and common sense.

Draymond Green is gone. That one hurts in the specific way that losing a player who defined an era always hurts. Green was the heartbeat, the talker, the defender who made the dynasty possible in ways the box score never fully captured. He goes to Boston, which feels both right and wrong — right because he will thrive in a system that values toughness, wrong because no Warrior should ever wear Celtic green.

Moses Moody, the quiet kid from Arkansas who never quite got the minutes he deserved, heads to Milwaukee with four first-round picks. That is the price. That is always the price. You trade the future for the now, and you pray that "now" lasts long enough to hang a banner.

At 28-24, this team was drifting toward the play-in, toward a first-round exit, toward the kind of mediocrity that eats franchises from the inside. Giannis changes the math. Giannis changes the gravity of every possession, every defensive rotation, every fast break. Jericho Sims gives them rim protection and rebounding off the bench — a throw-in who could become a rotation piece.

But here is what I keep coming back to, standing in that kitchen, reading the texts, watching the fireworks explode across social media: Oakland does not do things quietly. This city does not settle. We fight, we swing, we reach for something bigger than what the spreadsheet says we deserve.

The Warriors just reached.

Now we find out if the reach was worth it.

The fans do not want perfection. They want fight. And tonight, fight showed up wearing number 34.

THE PAULSON QUESTION: ONE GM, TWO CITIES, AND NOW A THIRD TEAM CALLING

By Anthony | Lead Beat Reporter | Bay Tribune Sports

The whiteboard in Mike Paulson's office at the Mesa training complex has two columns. One reads "OAK." The other reads "CHI." Both are filled with shorthand that only Paulson and his inner circle can decode — initials, dates, arrows connecting player names to roster slots. As of this week, sources say a third column may need to be added.

The Warriors have confirmed their interest in Paulson.

It is a sentence that would have been absurd twelve months ago. Paulson, the general manager who built the Oakland A's into a dynasty contender and then took on the Chicago Bulls as a simultaneous project, is now being courted by the most aggressive front office in basketball — a front office that just traded for Giannis Antetokounmpo and clearly has no intention of stopping there.

Paulson has offered no comment. His representatives have offered no comment. The A's organization, through a spokesperson, said only that "Mike's focus remains on both clubs he serves." The Bulls, at 34-14 and surging after their 108-91 win over the Hornets, declined to address the situation.

But the logistics tell a story that words do not.

Paulson currently operates on a schedule that would break most executives: three days in Mesa with the A's, three days in Chicago with the Bulls, and an office that stays open seven days a week because he is always in one city or the other. He boards flights the way most people board elevators — with routine exhaustion and a phone full of draft models.

The A's are entering a pivotal summer. Deacon Seymour is running his first spring training camp as manager, installing a system that Paulson himself designed. Vinnie Keane's farewell season is officially underway — the 2041 campaign will honor Keane, Benji Dillon, and the championship era that defined a generation in Montclair, Rockridge, and beyond. Darrin Davis, back from his ACL tear, is ready for preseason and expected to patrol center field again out of his Laurel District home base.

In Chicago, the Bulls are playing the best basketball in franchise history under Paulson's restructured roster. "The system travels," Paulson told a national outlet last month, invoking the Oakland model as the blueprint for everything he built on Lake Shore Drive.

Now the Warriors want that system too.

The question is not whether Paulson is capable. His track record answers that. The question is whether one human being — no matter how relentless, no matter how many red-eye flights he books — can serve three professional sports organizations without something breaking. The A's clubhouse has already felt the strain. Seymour, praised from a distance, has not yet had a sustained, in-person stretch with the GM who hired him. Players have noted it. Staff have noted it. Nobody has complained publicly, because winning papers over cracks, and the A's have been winning.

But cracks do not disappear. They wait.

Danny Horn, the starting pitcher from Temescal whom Paulson has publicly called "the best player in the league," is the kind of franchise cornerstone who needs a GM's full attention during contract years and legacy decisions. Mark Aitken, the third baseman from Piedmont Avenue who has been showing up at council floor votes and earning whispers about a post-career in politics, represents the kind of player-civic crossover that requires organizational support.

Paulson built something in Oakland that people said could not be built. Then he tried to build it again in Chicago, and it worked. If the Warriors come calling with real authority — and the Giannis trade suggests they are done half-measuring — Paulson will face a decision that no amount of whiteboard shorthand can simplify.

Three teams. Two cities. One man.

The math has never been harder.

STABILIZATION FUND CLEARS COUNCIL, BUT WEST OAKLAND ASKS: WHERE'S THE CHECK?

By Carmen Delaine | Civic Ledger
The Bay Tribune — Edition 79

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund is law. The 6-3 supermajority vote in Cycle 78 — secured by Councilmember Elliott Crane's surprise crossover from the CRC bloc — committed $28 million in reserve draws to shore up housing retention, small-business grants, and anti-displacement services along the 7th Street corridor and surrounding blocks. Councilwoman Denise Carter, who shepherded the measure from subcommittee to floor, called it "the most significant investment in West Oakland's stability in a generation."

That was last week. This week, in a neighborhood where promises have a history of arriving late or not at all, the question is simpler: When does the money show up?

According to city records, the fund's implementation now falls to the city administrator's office, which has 45 days from the date of passage to begin first disbursements. Carter's office confirmed the timeline in a written statement but declined to identify which programs would receive priority funding. A spokesperson said the administrator is "building the intake framework" and expects to announce application guidelines within three weeks.

For residents along Mandela Parkway and the surrounding blocks, the timeline is both encouraging and familiar.

"Forty-five days is fine. I can wait forty-five days," said Bruce Wright, 48, a line cook who has lived Downtown for more than two decades but whose family roots extend deep into West Oakland. "What I can't do is wait forty-five days and then hear it's been pushed to ninety. We've been down that road."

Wright said he watched the floor vote on a livestream from his phone during a break at work. He called the result "good news with an asterisk."

That asterisk hangs over much of the neighborhood's response. Community Director Hayes, who organized several of the public comment sessions that preceded the committee hearing, described the mood as "cautious optimism mixed with institutional fatigue."

"People here have seen bond measures, redevelopment funds, promise zones," Hayes said. "They know what passage looks like. They're waiting to see what implementation looks like."

The political mechanics of what made passage possible remain only partly visible. Crane's crossover YES fractured the CRC coalition that had blocked the measure in committee for months. But Crane himself — now participating remotely due to a broken leg sustained in an incident his office has not elaborated on — has not publicly explained his reversal. His office released a two-sentence statement the night of the vote and has said nothing since.

More notable: the silence from CRC colleagues Warren Ashford and Nina Chen, who both voted no. Neither has issued a public statement. Neither responded to Tribune requests for comment. In a council where factional discipline typically produces coordinated messaging within hours of a major vote, the absence of any CRC response has drawn attention from observers at City Hall.

Councilwoman Rivera, who represents West Oakland and voted yes, has been more direct.

"The fund is a down payment," Rivera said in a brief exchange after a community event this week. "Not a conclusion. We have to build the infrastructure to spend it well."

Rivera's framing — that passage is the beginning, not the end — may be the most honest assessment of where the Stabilization Fund stands. The $28 million is allocated but not yet programmed. The administrator's office must design application processes, identify eligible recipients, and establish oversight mechanisms, all within a compressed timeline that coincides with Independence holiday scheduling and reduced city staffing.

Dante Nelson, 41, a security guard who works and lives Downtown, said he has followed the Stabilization Fund debate closely but isn't sure it will reach the people who need it most.

"I work nights. I see who's sleeping in doorways on San Pablo. Those folks aren't going to fill out a grant application," Nelson said. "The question isn't whether the money exists. It's whether the pipeline reaches the ground."

The city administrator's office is expected to hold informational sessions in West Oakland before the end of the month. No dates have been announced.

THE CRC'S SILENCE: WHAT CRANE'S CROSSOVER BROKE — AND WHAT ASHFORD AND CHEN WON'T SAY

By Luis Navarro | Investigations
The Bay Tribune — Edition 79

Here's what we know. Elliott Crane, District 6 councilmember and a founding architect of the CRC coalition's fiscal restraint platform, voted yes on the West Oakland Stabilization Fund. That vote shattered a bloc that had held together on every major appropriation for the better part of two years. Here's what we don't know: why.

Crane's office has released no formal explanation. His two-sentence statement on the night of the vote — acknowledging his yes and thanking "the residents who shared their testimony" — was notable for what it did not contain: any reference to the CRC's stated position, any acknowledgment that he had broken with his coalition partners, or any signal of where he stands going forward.

I've spent the days since the vote requesting comment from all three CRC offices. The results are as follows:

Crane (D6): Referred all questions to his initial statement. A staffer added that the councilmember is "recovering from a leg injury and focused on constituent services." Crane has been participating in council business remotely.

Ashford (D7): Declined comment through a spokesperson. The spokesperson said Councilmember Ashford "continues to review pending appropriation proposals and will share his perspective at the appropriate time."

Chen (D8): Did not respond to three separate requests for comment submitted over four days.

In a body where post-vote messaging is typically a coordinated exercise — where factions issue joint statements, schedule press availabilities, and frame outcomes within hours — the CRC's collective silence is itself a form of communication. It suggests a coalition that has not yet decided what it is anymore.

Sources close to the committee process say the fracture was not entirely unexpected. Crane had asked pointed questions during the committee hearing about the fund's targeting mechanisms — questions that some observers interpreted as hostile but that, in retrospect, may have been an effort to strengthen the proposal before voting for it. One source described Crane's posture in the final hearing as "a man looking for a reason to say yes."

That interpretation is contested. Others familiar with CRC deliberations say Crane's crossover blindsided Ashford, who had been operating under the assumption that all three CRC members would hold the line.

The political implications extend beyond the Stabilization Fund itself. Two major votes are approaching: the Temescal Community Health Center appropriation next cycle, which is projected to pass 5-4 with OPP support, and the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative in Cycle 82, which remains a genuine toss-up. In both cases, the math turns on swing voters Ramon Vega and Leonard Tran — but the CRC's ability to hold its three votes together is now an open question.

Ashford's silence is particularly significant. The Temescal Health Center sits squarely in his District 7. He has been publicly skeptical of the appropriation on fiscal grounds, but he has not committed to a no vote. His spokesperson's language this week — "continues to review the appropriation proposal" — is the kind of careful noncommitment that typically precedes either a dramatic reversal or a quiet abstention.

"Ashford is in a box," said one City Hall observer who requested anonymity because they work with multiple council offices. "If he votes no on a health center in his own district, he has to explain that to his constituents for the next three years. If he votes yes, the CRC is functionally dissolved as a fiscal bloc."

Chen's silence is harder to read. She has historically been the coalition's most disciplined messenger, coordinating CRC responses and maintaining factional coherence on procedural votes. Her refusal to comment — not even a boilerplate acknowledgment — suggests either a strategic pause or a genuine rupture in internal communication.

What is clear is that the Stabilization Fund vote changed the council's operating dynamics. The OPP now knows that CRC unity can be broken. The CRC knows that its members are capable of independent action. And every upcoming vote will be viewed through the lens of whether the bloc holds — or whether the cracks that Crane opened continue to widen.

Crane himself remains out of public view, recovering from his injury. His office has not provided a timeline for his return to in-person sessions. When he does return, he will walk into a chamber where the rules of engagement have shifted — and where two of his closest political allies have, so far, chosen not to say a word about why.

TEMESCAL HEALTH CENTER VOTE APPROACHES: A NEIGHBORHOOD CAUGHT BETWEEN NEED AND POLITICS

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Health Desk
The Bay Tribune — Edition 79

The timeline is straightforward. Next cycle, the Oakland City Council will vote on the Temescal Community Health Center appropriation — a proposal to fund a new full-service community clinic on Telegraph Avenue between 49th and 51st Streets, intended to serve a catchment area that currently relies on a patchwork of urgent care facilities, mobile clinics, and an overburdened emergency room at Highland Hospital twenty minutes away by bus.

The projection: 5-4, likely to pass. The variable: Councilmember Warren Ashford, who represents District 7 — the district where the health center would be built — and who has spent months expressing what his office calls "fiscal concerns" about the appropriation.

What those fiscal concerns mean in practice is a matter of interpretation. The health center proposal carries a $12 million first-phase construction cost and an estimated $3.4 million annual operating budget, partially offset by Medi-Cal reimbursements and a county matching grant that expires if not drawn down by the end of the fiscal year. Supporters argue the math is tight but workable. Skeptics point to the Stabilization Fund's $28 million draw and ask whether the city can absorb another major commitment within the same budget window.

But the clinical case is harder to argue against.

Temescal's health indicators have been trending in a direction that public health professionals describe as concerning. Illness rates in the broader Grand Lake area — which shares demographic overlap with Temescal's northern blocks — are up significantly, according to Alameda County health data released this month. Clinic utilization at the two nearest facilities has exceeded capacity thresholds during peak hours for three consecutive reporting periods.

"We had a working theory that the existing infrastructure could absorb the neighborhood's growth," said a county health official who spoke on background because they are not authorized to discuss pending municipal proposals. "That theory stopped being viable about six months ago."

Jose Wright, 26, an electrician who lives in Temescal, described a system that works only if nothing goes wrong.

"My kid had an ear infection last month. Couldn't get into the clinic on 51st — two-hour wait, they were turning people away by noon. Drove to the urgent care in Emeryville. That's forty-five minutes round trip in the middle of a workday," Wright said. "You tell me we don't need a health center."

Andre Lee, 55, also an electrician and a longtime Temescal resident, offered a more measured assessment. "I've seen proposals come and go in this neighborhood. The old Pill Hill expansion, the mobile clinic pilot that lasted eight months. I'm not against a health center. I just want to know who's going to run it, who's going to staff it, and whether it's still going to be there in five years."

Lee's concern echoes a pattern that has surfaced in public comment sessions: support for the concept paired with skepticism about execution. The proposal identifies a nonprofit operator — details of the management agreement have not been made public — and assumes a staffing ramp-up that relies on recruitment pipelines that don't currently exist in the immediate area.

Ashford's position remains the political fulcrum. His spokesperson this week repeated the formulation that has become familiar: "Councilmember Ashford continues to review the appropriation proposal." That language has not changed in three weeks. It is neither a yes nor a no. It is, in the parlance of City Hall, a hold — a posture that preserves flexibility while denying both sides a clear read.

What makes Ashford's calculus more complex is the CRC fracture exposed by the Stabilization Fund vote. If Ashford votes yes on the health center, he would be the second CRC member in two cycles to break with the bloc's fiscal restraint position. If he votes no, he votes against a health facility in his own district at a moment when health indicators in the area are worsening.

The OPP bloc — Carter, Delgado, Rivers, and Mobley — is expected to vote yes unanimously. That means passage requires one of the two swing votes: Vega or Tran. Current projections suggest the measure passes regardless of Ashford's position, but a yes from the district's own representative would carry symbolic weight that extends well beyond the vote count.

Bruce Lee, 57, a retail worker in Temescal, put it simply: "If your own councilman won't vote for a clinic in your neighborhood, what does that tell you about how he sees us?"

The vote is expected in the next council session.

LAKE MERRITT FOURTH OF JULY DRAWS CROWDS — AND EXPOSES STRAIN ON AGING INFRASTRUCTURE

By Trevor Shimizu | Transit & Infrastructure
The Bay Tribune — Edition 79

The culvert intake at the northeastern corner of Lake Merritt — the concrete channel where tidal flow from the estuary meets the lake's stormwater system — was running at visible capacity on Thursday evening, even before the Independence Day crowds arrived. Standing water pooled along the pedestrian path near the Pergola, slicking the concrete and forcing joggers onto the grass. By early evening, when holiday foot traffic from the Lakeshore corridor began to swell, city maintenance crews had placed four orange traffic cones around the wet zone and taped off a section of railing.

That's not routine. That's a maintenance backlog catching up.

Lake Merritt's inflow system — a network of drainage channels, tidal gates, and stormwater pipes, much of it dating to a 2002 restoration project — has been operating at what engineers would recognize as tolerance limits since late spring. Public Works records obtained by the Tribune show three maintenance requests related to inflow capacity filed since May, none of which have been fully resolved. Two involved sediment accumulation in the tidal channel. The third flagged a "partial blockage" in a secondary overflow pipe near the 12th Street outfall.

Individually, these are routine infrastructure items — the kind of thing that appears in maintenance logs and gets scheduled for quarterly attention. Collectively, they describe a system that is absorbing more water than it was designed to handle, at a time when the lake's surrounding population density has increased measurably.

Carmen Delaine reported in Edition 78 on population growth straining services along the lake's east shore. The infrastructure data supports that picture. According to Public Works service records, the lake's drainage system was last comprehensively inspected in 2019. The population within a half-mile radius of the lake has grown by an estimated 14 percent since then, bringing additional impervious surface area — rooftops, parking lots, compacted soil from foot traffic — that increases stormwater runoff into the lake's intake system.

"These events are unrelated on paper. Except they're both symptoms of the same thing," said a Public Works engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss internal maintenance assessments. "More people, more runoff, same pipes."

The Independence Day holiday amplified the pressure. Lake Merritt is Oakland's default public gathering space for the Fourth — families set up blankets along the north shore, food vendors line Grand Avenue, and the fireworks viewing area near the amphitheater draws thousands. This year, with overcast skies keeping temperatures at a mild 62 degrees, the crowd arrived early and stayed late.

Hector Campbell, 32, a taxi driver from Rockridge who was picking up fares along Lakeshore Avenue, described the scene as "packed but not crazy — until you got near the water."

"There was a whole section by the boathouse where you couldn't walk without stepping in puddles. People were asking if a pipe had burst," Campbell said. "It wasn't a burst. It was just... full."

A crowd control issue near the amphitheater required additional police presence in the early evening hours, according to sources familiar with the response. No injuries were reported, and the situation was resolved without incident, but the combination of high foot traffic and compromised drainage created conditions that stretched the capacity of both public safety and public works crews.

The broader concern is what happens when these micro-failures — a pooling culvert here, a blocked overflow pipe there — begin to compound. Lake Merritt's infrastructure was designed for a different Oakland: one with fewer residents within the drainage basin, less impervious surface, and a maintenance schedule that assumed consistent quarterly attention. What it is getting instead is deferred maintenance, increased load, and a growing gap between the system's design capacity and its actual operating conditions.

Xavier Campbell, 45, a mover who lives on Piedmont Avenue and walks the lake most mornings, said the changes have been gradual but unmistakable.

"Three years ago, that path by the Pergola was dry all summer. Now there's standing water after every high tide. It's not dramatic — it's slow," Campbell said. "But slow is how infrastructure fails. You don't notice until you can't ignore it."

Public Works has not announced any accelerated maintenance schedule for the lake's drainage system. The next quarterly inspection, according to department records, is not scheduled until September.

BUSINESS TICKER — CYCLE 79

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

The Fourth landed on a First Friday this cycle, and Oakland's commercial corridors felt it. Retail load across the city ran hot all week, with foot traffic peaking Thursday evening as the holiday crowd merged with the regular First Friday wave. Jack London and Uptown absorbed the heaviest volume. KONO saw its usual gallery-walk surge amplified by holiday spillover, and Temescal held steady with its weekend brunch-and-boutique rhythm pulling consistent spending.

— Retail load: Elevated across all major corridors. Jack London and Uptown running well above seasonal baseline. Temescal and Fruitvale steady.
— Economic influence: Elevated. Tourism bump plus holiday weekend plus First Friday convergence. Triple overlap like this is rare and it shows in the register totals.
— Trend: Evening-weighted spending. Daytime retail hummed but nightfall is where the real volume hit. Restaurants and bars carried the week.
— Top dining: Copper Dock Kitchen (Jack London), The Almanac Table (Uptown)
— Fast casual: Masa Verde (Temescal)
— Nightlife volume: High and building. Jack London buzzing from happy hour through last call. Uptown surging with post-fireworks energy. (Festive, shoulder-to-shoulder on Broadway)
— Active spots: Copper Dock Kitchen, The Almanac Table, Bardo Lounge (KONO)

The overcast marine layer kept temperatures at 62 degrees all evening — perfect conditions for patio dining without the fog-chill complaints. Expect the momentum to carry through the weekend as First Friday foot traffic lingers into Saturday markets.

STABILIZATION MONEY MEETS THE HOLIDAY RUSH: WEST OAKLAND BUSINESSES EYE THE CLOCK

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

The $28 million West Oakland Stabilization Fund passed last cycle with broad council support and a 45-day disbursement window. That means the first checks could start moving by mid-August. For the small business owners along Seventh Street and the emerging storefronts near Mandela Parkway, the question is no longer whether help is coming — it is whether it arrives in time.

July's holiday weekend offered a useful snapshot of the tension. While Jack London's restaurant row packed tables from Thursday through Sunday, the western corridors that the Stabilization Fund was designed to protect saw a more modest bump. The money flows east and stays east. That geographic imbalance is precisely what the fund aims to correct.

Owen Campbell, 40, a bakery worker in Jack London, has watched the district's commercial growth from behind the counter for years. "Holiday weekends here, we don't slow down," Campbell said. "But I grew up closer to West Oakland and the energy is different over there. People want to spend. There's just less to spend it on."

The fund's architecture targets three categories: lease stabilization grants for existing businesses facing rent escalation, capital improvement micro-loans for facade and equipment upgrades, and corridor activation grants designed to attract new tenants to long-vacant commercial spaces. City economic development staff have signaled that lease stabilization will be the first tranche, given urgency around several pending rent renegotiations along the Seventh Street corridor.

What the investment pipeline looks like from here matters. The holiday weekend proved again that Oakland has the consumer demand — Jack London and Uptown posted some of their strongest evening numbers of the year, with multiple nightlife venues in both districts reporting capacity crowds. The Stabilization Fund's bet is that West Oakland can capture a share of that demand if the commercial infrastructure gets a floor beneath it.

Guadalupe Lee, a bartender working Uptown's Friday rush, put it simply: "People come out when there's somewhere to go. Build it on the west side, they'll show up there too."

Forty-five days. The clock is running.

SMOKE, SPARKLERS, AND THE QUESTION OF WHOSE INDEPENDENCE
Oakland's Fourth of July Stretches From Lake Merritt to East Oakland — And Means Something Different on Every Block

By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison

The smoke found you before the music did.

On the grassy slope above Lake Merritt's eastern shore, Calvin Turner had his grill going by ten in the morning. Tri-tip, links, chicken thighs rubbed with something he would only describe as "family business." His two daughters chased each other around a folding table loaded with potato salad, watermelon, and a flag cake that was already losing a few stars to the heat. Nearby, a knot of families had staked out blankets and pop-up canopies in a loose perimeter that suggested years of practice — everyone knew where everyone else would be.

"We've been doing this spot for maybe eight, nine years," Turner said, flipping a row of links without looking down. "My wife's people started it. Now it's just the Fourth. You don't plan it. You just show up."

That is the rhythm of Independence Day in Oakland — not the single, official, ticketed version, but the decentralized, neighborhood-by-neighborhood constellation of gatherings that turn the city into a patchwork of charcoal smoke and bass-heavy speakers from mid-morning to well past midnight. There is no one Oakland Fourth. There are dozens.

In Fruitvale, Rafael Phillips was working a double at a restaurant on International Boulevard, but he had already put in his hours at his family's backyard gathering before clocking in. "My mom had tamales going at seven a.m.," he said, tying his apron. "That's our Fourth. The fireworks are whatever — the food is the holiday."

The holiday's texture shifts block by block. In Adams Point, the mood was quieter. Elijah Campbell, who has driven a cab in Oakland for more than two decades, parked near the Lake Merritt United Methodist Church, where the congregation held a special sermon addressing community concerns alongside its seniors lunch program, which marked a milestone this cycle. "I like the Fourth because people are out," Campbell said. "You feel the city. Even when it's overcast like today — sixty-two degrees, the fog sitting on us — people still come out."

That overcast sky — classic Oakland summer, the marine layer that visitors mistake for gloom but residents read as a promise that the afternoon will warm — hung over everything. It softened the bunting on Piedmont Avenue porches. It muffled the early pops of illegal fireworks that started around two o'clock and built steadily through the evening.

Not everyone welcomed the noise. On Piedmont Avenue, at least one fireworks debris complaint was logged, the kind of friction that recurs every July: spent casings on sidewalks, car alarms tripped, dogs trembling under beds. Terrence Wright, a mover who lives on the avenue, was philosophical about it. "It's one night," he said. "Maybe two. You deal with it. But I get why people with pets or little kids get upset."

In Chinatown, a BBQ grill flare-up drew a brief emergency response — no injuries, no structural damage, just the sharp reminder that a holiday built around open flame and explosives carries inherent risk. Ronald Scott, an electrician who has lived in the neighborhood for years, watched the engine pull away. "Happens every year somewhere," he said. "You just hope nobody gets hurt."

Over in Rockridge, a sparkler burn incident — minor, treated on scene — added to the cycle's tally of small holiday disruptions. The kind of incidents that never make the front page but accumulate in the texture of a city's summer.

But the texture of Oakland's Fourth is not primarily about disruption. It is about the weight of gathering. At Allen Temple Baptist Church in East Oakland, the choir performed during a service that drew the faithful from across the flatlands. The church's food pantry operated the same day, serving neighbors — the dual mission of celebration and sustenance that defines so much of Oakland's faith infrastructure. At Cathedral of Christ the Light near Lake Merritt, a special sermon addressed community concerns, and the church activated its emergency assistance fund, a quiet signal that even in a season of celebration, need persists.

Down at the lake itself, the scene by evening was dense and festive. Families had claimed every bench. Food trucks lined the paths — and at least one dispute over a food truck line was reported, the kind of minor friction that comes with density and desire and a city that wants to be in the same place at the same time.

Marco Johnson, a nurse aide from Adams Point, was sitting on a bench near the boathouse with a plate balanced on his knee. "I work nights usually," he said. "So the Fourth is one of the few times I'm actually out here when it's busy. It's a lot. But it's good. You see Oakland being Oakland."

That is what the Fourth reveals: not a single narrative of patriotism or protest, but a city doing what it does — gathering in its own specific, neighborhood-coded, food-centered, occasionally chaotic way. The smoke rises from Fruitvale and from the lake and from Chinatown and from the hills, and for one long summer day, the city smells like itself.

FIRST FRIDAY IN JULY: WHEN THE ART WALK MEETS THE AFTERGLOW
Telegraph Avenue Comes Alive as Oakland's Galleries, Street Artists, and Night Crowds Collide With Holiday Energy

By Kai Marston | Arts & Entertainment

The air was already shifting on Telegraph by six o'clock.

You could feel it in the way the foot traffic thickened between 23rd and 27th — that particular First Friday compression where the sidewalk stops being a sidewalk and becomes a current. The galleries had their doors thrown open. The food trucks were idling into position along the side streets off KONO. And somewhere up the block, a sound system was testing levels, bass notes rolling down the asphalt like something searching for a wall to bounce off of.

July's First Friday carried a double charge. The Fourth of July had just passed, and the city was still buzzing with that post-holiday looseness — people who had taken the week off, visitors who had stayed through the weekend, the general sense that Oakland had given itself permission to stretch the celebration one more night. The overcast sky, sixty-two degrees and holding, kept the light soft and even. No glare. No squinting. Just that gray-pearl Oakland summer sky that makes neon signs and gallery lighting pop like they were designed for exactly this weather.

In KONO, Sculptor Alma Vasquez had new work visible through the broad front window of her studio — steel and reclaimed wood pieces that looked like they were arguing with each other about what a bridge is supposed to do. A small crowd gathered on the sidewalk, peering in. Vasquez is one of those KONO fixtures whose presence anchors the neighborhood's identity as a working arts district, not just a gallery corridor. Her studio is a studio — dust, welding masks, the smell of cut metal.

Up the avenue, the Uptown galleries were running hot. Rico Valez, one of Oakland's most visible arts figures, had work showing — mixed-media pieces that drew a line through the crowd like a magnet pulling filings. Valez's profile has only grown in recent cycles, and his presence at First Friday functions as a kind of gravitational center: where his work shows, people gather. Nearby, Lena Cross — another Uptown arts figure whose name keeps appearing in gallery listings and cultural conversations — was spotted in the crowd, moving between openings with the practiced ease of someone who has done this route many times.

Muralist Dante Reyes, whose KONO murals have become part of the neighborhood's visual vocabulary, was out on the avenue talking to admirers near one of his walls. First Friday is the night when the street art and the gallery art occupy the same space, when the work that lives outdoors and the work that lives behind glass share an audience. Reyes bridges that gap — his murals are the neighborhood's public collection, free and permanent and impossible to ignore.

The music situation was, as always, layered. Jade Orion, the Temescal musician whose name has been circulating in local arts circles, was performing on a side-street stage — a set that blended electronic textures with live guitar, the kind of sound that rewards standing still in a crowd that keeps moving. The contrast was the point: amid the flow and chatter of First Friday, Orion's music created small pockets of attention, people stopping mid-stride to listen for a measure or two before the current pulled them on.

Jose Wright, an electrician from Temescal, was leaning against a light pole near the stage, arms crossed, nodding along. "I come every month if I can," he said. "It's the one night where the whole city feels like it's on the same frequency. You've got families, you've got the art crowd, you've got people who just want to walk and eat. It all works."

Down toward Jack London, the nightlife surge was building. The evening foot traffic spilled south from Uptown, filling bars and restaurants along the waterfront corridor. Jalen Hill, a line cook at a Jack London spot, was deep into service when the First Friday wave hit his restaurant. "You can feel it in the ticket rail," he said during a brief pause. "Around eight, eight-thirty, the orders just stack. That's First Friday plus the holiday week. We prep for it, but it still hits."

Marcus Walker, a dishwasher at another Jack London establishment, had a more philosophical take. "I've been washing dishes in this city for a long time," he said. "First Friday nights, you see it in the plates. People order more, they share more, they try things they wouldn't normally try. The plates come back different on First Friday."

The night stretched. By ten o'clock, Telegraph was still thick with bodies, the gallery lights still burning, the food trucks still turning out plates. Marin Tao, the Piedmont Avenue arts celebrity whose profile is among the highest in Oakland's cultural landscape, was seen moving through the Uptown crowd — a sighting that rippled through social media feeds and confirmed what the avenue already knew: July's First Friday was a night worth showing up for.

What makes Oakland's First Friday endure, month after month, is that it is not curated from above. It is an accumulation — galleries deciding to stay open, musicians deciding to play, food trucks deciding to park, people deciding to walk. The result is not a festival. It is a city warming up for a night that planned to stretch long past its bedtime.

THE CHURCHES, MOSQUES, AND TEMPLES THAT FED OAKLAND THIS WEEK
Across Faiths and Neighborhoods, Houses of Worship Quietly Held the City Together Over the Holiday

By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison

The food pantry line at Allen Temple Baptist Church started forming before the doors opened.

It does every time. East Oakland knows the schedule. Families, seniors, people who drove and people who walked — they gathered on the sidewalk in the overcast morning light, patient and familiar with the routine. Inside, volunteers sorted cans and produce into bags. Outside, the line grew. This is what Allen Temple does: it feeds people. It has been feeding people for a long time, and it will feed people next month, and the month after that.

But Allen Temple was not alone this cycle. Across Oakland, houses of worship mobilized with an intensity that spoke to both the season and the need. The Fourth of July is a holiday that fills parks and backyards, but for Oakland's faith communities, it was also a week of service — food pantries, health fairs, special sermons, choir performances, tutoring programs, emergency funds. The scale was remarkable. From Downtown to East Oakland, from Temescal to Fruitvale, from Chinatown to Adams Point, the city's faith infrastructure operated at full capacity.

At First Presbyterian Church downtown, a community health fair opened its doors — blood pressure screenings, nutrition counseling, wellness resources spread across folding tables in the fellowship hall. Dante Nelson, a security guard who works downtown, stopped by on his break. "I didn't even know they were doing it until I walked past," he said. "Got my blood pressure checked. It was fine. But the fact that they're just there, doing it, on a holiday week — that says something."

It says something about the faith community's role in Oakland: not as a Sunday-only institution, but as a weekday, every-day infrastructure that operates parallel to — and often ahead of — the city's official services.

At Cathedral of Christ the Light, the cycle was heavier than usual. A special sermon addressed community concerns — the kind of pastoral response that arrives when a congregation feels the weight of the moment. More pointedly, the cathedral activated its emergency assistance fund, a step that signals real, material need among parishioners. The cathedral sits near Lake Merritt, in the shadow of downtown's glass towers, and the distance between those towers and the people lining up for emergency funds is measured in something harder than blocks.

In Fruitvale, St. Columba Catholic Church's choir filled the sanctuary during services — voices lifting through the nave in a neighborhood where the sound of church bells still marks the hours. Calvin Turner, a mechanic who lives nearby, said the music carries. "You can hear it on the street sometimes," he said. "My kids know what it means. It means it's Sunday. Or it means something's happening."

Something was happening everywhere.

In Adams Point, Lake Merritt United Methodist Church held a special sermon and celebrated a milestone in its seniors lunch program — a program that has been feeding elderly residents with the kind of regularity that becomes invisible until you imagine it gone. Across town in West Oakland, Acts Full Gospel Church drew its faithful for weekly service, the kind of steady, undramatic gathering that rarely makes the news but forms the bedrock of a neighborhood's spiritual life.

Beth Jacob Congregation on Piedmont Avenue hosted a guest speaker, drawing members and visitors into conversation. In Temescal, the Islamic Center of Oakland ran its own food pantry — a parallel effort to Allen Temple's, operating in a different tradition but with the same purpose: nobody in the neighborhood should go hungry.

In East Oakland, Masjid Al-Islam held its weekly service and expanded its after-school tutoring program — a signal that the mosque's investment in the neighborhood extends beyond prayer to education, to the practical work of making sure young people have somewhere to go and someone to help them with their homework.

The Oakland Buddhist Temple in Chinatown and the East Bay Meditation Center downtown both observed Losar, the Tibetan New Year — a reminder that Oakland's faith calendar does not run on a single clock. And in Grand Lake, Kehilla Community Synagogue operated its food pantry, another node in the citywide network of congregations that have decided, collectively and without formal coordination, that feeding people is part of the job.

At First Unitarian Church near Lake Merritt, a new session of the job training workshop began — connecting faith-based service to economic mobility, the kind of practical spirituality that Oakland's progressive congregations have made their signature.

Gallery Owner Mei Chen, the Laurel-based curator who has been documenting the faith community's work as an ongoing project, sees a pattern that outsiders miss. The documentation effort — capturing what these institutions do week after week — matters because it makes visible what Oakland often takes for granted: that the city's safety net is not only made of government programs. It is made of choir directors and food pantry volunteers and imams who stay late and pastors who answer the phone.

Howard Young, a barista in Rockridge, put it simply. "I'm not a churchgoing person," he said. "But I know what the churches do. Everybody knows. When things get hard, that's where people go. Not city hall. The church."

Brian Williams, a mechanic in Chinatown, echoed the sentiment from a different angle. "I go to temple sometimes," he said. "Not every week. But I know they're there. That's the thing — they're always there."

They are always there. In a city that celebrates its diversity as a matter of identity, the faith communities are the infrastructure that proves it — not in statements or slogans, but in bags of groceries, blood pressure cuffs, tutoring sessions, and the steady sound of voices lifted together on a gray summer morning.

HORN, AITKEN, AND A WIFFLEBALL BAT: A'S PLAYERS CELEBRATE THE STABILIZATION FUND IN WEST OAKLAND

By Tanya Cruz | Sideline Reporter | Bay Tribune Sports | #InsideTheAs

BREAKING from West Oakland: Danny Horn showed up with 200 wiffleball bats and a grin the size of the Coliseum scoreboard.

The A's starting pitcher sponsored a wiffleball tournament in West Oakland on Saturday afternoon — a block-party-style celebration of the Stabilization Fund that passed earlier this cycle, the community investment package that has been the talk of every neighborhood council meeting from Fruitvale to Rockridge. And Horn did not just write a check and send a press release. He was there. Bat in hand. Jersey untucked. Throwing underhanded to kids who could barely hold the bat level.

"I grew up playing wiffleball on dead-end streets in Temescal," Horn told me between innings — and yes, they played actual innings, with actual umpires, on a field chalked into a parking lot off Mandela Parkway. "When I heard the Fund passed, I wanted to do something that felt like what this neighborhood already does. People here celebrate together. I just brought the bats."

Mark Aitken was there too. The third baseman, fresh off his appearance at a council floor vote that turned heads across the sports and civic worlds, arrived quietly and stayed loud. He coached a team of eight-year-olds, drew up plays on a napkin, and at one point was spotted arguing a call at first base with a volunteer umpire who could not have been older than sixteen.

"Mark takes everything seriously," Horn said, laughing. "Even wiffleball. Especially wiffleball."

Manager Deacon Seymour made an appearance midday, shaking hands and talking to parents about the upcoming season. It was Seymour's first real public event in Oakland since taking the job, and the reception was warm — handshakes, selfies, a few older fans telling him about managers they remembered from the Coliseum's earlier eras. GM Mike Paulson was also in attendance, though sources say he arrived late and left early, consistent with his compressed schedule between Mesa and Chicago.

The mood was pure July Fourth weekend energy. Grills smoking on every corner. Kids in A's jerseys running the bases — some wearing Vinnie Keane throwbacks, some wearing Horn's number. A few enterprising teenagers set up a bracket and ran a legitimate double-elimination tournament that drew a crowd three deep along the foul lines.

This is the part of sports that does not make the box score. Danny Horn's ERA will be what it is. Mark Aitken's batting average will tell one story. But the image of two franchise players spending their Saturday in West Oakland, surrounded by the people who actually live in the neighborhoods these stadiums sit in — that is a different kind of stat.

The Stabilization Fund has been debated in policy terms for months. On Saturday, it looked like 200 wiffleball bats and a parking lot full of people who finally have a reason to believe the investment is real.

Horn is expected back at the Mesa facility Monday. Aitken, knowing him, will probably stop at City Hall first.

THE LAST SUMMER OF VINNIE KEANE: WHERE A FAREWELL SEASON FITS IN THE OAKLAND CANON

By Hal Richmond | Senior Historian | Bay Tribune Sports

In 1974, the Oakland Athletics held a celebration day for a veteran outfielder whose knees had finally betrayed him. The Coliseum was half-full. The ceremony lasted eleven minutes. The man received a watch and a standing ovation that ended before the national anthem began. His name does not appear on any plaque inside the stadium.

Oakland has never been good at goodbyes.

This summer, the franchise has a chance to change that. Vinnie Keane's farewell season is officially underway, and the 2041 campaign will honor not just Keane but the entire championship era — Benji Dillon, the rotation that carried October, the teams that made Montclair and Rockridge feel like the center of the baseball universe.

Keane has earned every syllable of whatever praise this city offers. His career statistics belong in the conversation with the franchise's all-time greats, men whose names are painted on the walls of the Coliseum concourse and whispered in barbershops from Laurel to Fruitvale. But statistics are the least interesting thing about Vinnie Keane.

What matters is that he stayed.

In an era when free agency scatters rosters like leaves in an October wind, Keane chose Oakland. When larger markets offered larger contracts — and they did, repeatedly, according to sources who were in those rooms — Keane chose the city that raised him as a player. He chose Montclair mornings and Coliseum nights. He chose the fog and the overcast summers and the particular quality of East Bay light that photographers like DJ Hartley have spent careers trying to capture.

The dynasty celebration planned for the 2041 season will bring former players back to the Coliseum. Young players will be shown what the organization calls "the expectation" — a word that carries specific weight in a clubhouse where championship banners hang above the lockers. Benji Dillon, the starting pitcher from Rockridge who was Keane's contemporary and co-architect of the dynasty years, will be central to the festivities.

When you have written about the same team for nearly four decades, you learn the rhythm of their seasons the way sailors learn tides. There are years of building, years of contending, and years of saying goodbye. The goodbye years are the hardest to write about because they ask you to hold two truths at once: gratitude for what was, and grief for what will not come again.

Keane's final season will unfold under Deacon Seymour's management — a new skipper inheriting a clubhouse that still belongs, spiritually, to the men who built it. Seymour opens against San Diego, and the roster around Keane is not a farewell gift. Danny Horn on the mound, Darrin Davis back in center field after his ACL recovery, Mark Aitken at third base bringing his peculiar blend of athletic excellence and civic consciousness, Isley Kelley at shortstop — this is a team constructed to compete, not merely to commemorate.

That is the Oakland way. You honor the past by refusing to surrender the present.

Arturo Ramos in left field, Edmundo Peña closing games from his Jack London apartment, Buford Park and Martin Richards rounding out a rotation that Anthony Casto supports from the bullpen, John Ellis providing depth — this roster has the bones of something real. Mike Kinder, the manager from Temescal who has guided these men through daily preparation, understands that Keane's farewell is not a funeral. It is a foundation.

The question this columnist has been asked most frequently this summer, by readers and colleagues alike, is simple: Where does Vinnie Keane rank?

The answer requires context that numbers alone cannot provide. Keane ranks wherever you place loyalty in your hierarchy of athletic virtues. He ranks wherever you put the decision to stay when leaving would have been easier and more lucrative. He ranks wherever Oakland itself ranks in your understanding of what a sports city can be.

The Coliseum will be full for his last game. The ceremony will last longer than eleven minutes. And this time, Oakland will get the goodbye right.

CHICAGO SPORTS

HOLIDAY SEASON: BULLS GO ALL-IN AT THE DEADLINE, ADD CHAMPIONSHIP PEDIGREE TO LEAGUE'S BEST RECORD
By Selena Grant | Bulls Beat Reporter

The whiteboard in the front office on West Madison still had Tuesday's practice rotations scribbled in blue marker when the calls started coming. By the time the trade deadline closed, there were two new names written at the bottom in red: Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons. The board looked different. So did the Bulls' championship math.

At 37-15 — the best record in the Eastern Conference and the franchise's finest first-half pace since the dynasty years — Chicago did not need to make a move. Mike Paulson made two anyway.

The headline acquisition is Holiday, the veteran guard secured from a deal that sent Tre Jones — still recovering from the broken left ankle suffered two weeks ago — and a second-round pick out the door. The numbers alone justify the exchange. Holiday is a two-way force with a championship ring and postseason minutes that dwarf anything on this roster not named Josh Giddey. Jones was a reliable backup, a steady hand, a good locker room presence. But the broken ankle complicated his short-term value, and reliable backup guards — healthy or not — do not win you a conference finals series. Holiday might.

"It's not about what we're losing," a team source said of the Jones departure. "It's about what the starting five looks like in May."

That starting five now projects as a nightmare for opposing coaches: Giddey at the point, running his 17.9-point, 9-assist, 7-rebound triple-double machine. Holiday slotting in at the two, providing the perimeter defense this team lacked in close games. Matas Buzelis at the four, whose Most Improved Player candidacy has been built on a midrange game that did not exist fourteen months ago. Patrick Williams at the four. And Hank Trepagnier — the 7-foot rookie who is averaging 16.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 5.4 assists and has not merely entered the Rookie of the Year conversation but is chairing it — anchoring the middle.

The Simmons signing is the riskier bet. Signed for the remainder of the season on a veteran minimum deal, Simmons has not played meaningful minutes in years, and his reputation precedes him. But Paulson's calculus appears to be about depth, not stardom. With Walker Kessler providing backup center minutes and Kevin Huerter returning from his nagging hamstring issue, Simmons slots in as a versatile forward who can defend multiple positions and push the ball in transition. If he can stay engaged, the Bulls get a Swiss Army knife off the bench. If he cannot, they have barely invested anything to find out.

The deeper question — the one nobody inside the United Center will answer directly — is whether Paulson himself will be here to see this roster reach its potential. The Warriors' interest in luring him away from his dual-GM role overseeing both the Oakland A's and the Bulls has moved beyond rumor. Paulson's current arrangement — three days a week in Mesa for the A's, three days in Chicago, office communications seven days — is already a logistical marvel. Adding a third franchise to the courtship does not simplify things.

But in the coaches' hallway after the trade deadline closed, the mood was not about Paulson's future. It was about what he had just built. Isaac Okoro was studying film of Holiday's defensive switches. Ayo Dosunmu was texting Jones goodbye. Adash Stanley, the second rookie who has quietly earned minutes at backup point guard, was asking a staffer where Holiday's locker would be.

Noa Essengue and Keshad Johnson — the deep bench forwards who have provided energy in blowouts — now have even more competition for minutes. Jalen Smith and Simon Fontecchio round out a rotation that is suddenly twelve players deep with postseason experience at the top and youth at the bottom.

The All-Star selections are due next cycle. Multiple Bulls are in the conversation. But All-Star weekend is not what this roster was assembled for. The whiteboard says it plainly enough: these moves were made for June.

Names Index: Jrue Holiday (Guard — newly acquired), Tre Jones (Guard — traded), Ben Simmons (Forward — newly signed), Josh Giddey (PG), Hank Trepagnier (C — ROY leader), Matas Buzelis (PF — MIP candidate), Patrick Williams (PF), Walker Kessler (C), Kevin Huerter (SG), Isaac Okoro (SF), Ayo Dosunmu (Guard), Adash Stanley (PG — Rookie), Noa Essengue (F), Keshad Johnson (F), Jalen Smith (F/C), Simon Fontecchio (F), Mike Paulson (GM — Bulls/A's), Selena Grant (Bulls Beat Reporter)

CHICAGO GROUND

BRIDGEPORT TO BRONZEVILLE, THE CITY THAT BELIEVES AGAIN
By Talia Finch | Chicago Ground Reporter

The hydrant on Halsted was running again Wednesday evening, a silver arc of water catching the late July sun, and three kids were dancing through it in Bulls jerseys — two Trepagnier 00s and a faded Giddey 3 that had clearly belonged to an older sibling first. On a stoop across the street, a woman fanned herself with a folded Tribune and watched them without worry. Eighty-five degrees and humid, the kind of Chicago summer evening that sticks to your skin and slows the whole city down to porch-sitting speed. But nobody on this block was sitting still.

The trade deadline news had broken two hours earlier, and Bridgeport was already processing it the way Bridgeport processes everything: loudly, over food, with opinions that brook no disagreement. Through the screen door of a corner tap, you could hear the argument clearly — Holiday, they said, was the piece. The missing piece. The piece that turns thirty-seven wins into a parade down Michigan Avenue.

Walk east into Bronzeville and the frequency changes but the signal stays the same. The barber chairs were full despite the heat, and every conversation circled back to the same question: is this the year? At 37-15, the Bulls own the best record in the Eastern Conference. The rookies — Trepagnier and Stanley — play with the fearlessness of players who do not yet understand what they are supposed to be afraid of. And now Paulson, the man who built this from the rubble of a lottery team, has added a champion's steadiness in Holiday.

There is a particular quality to a Chicago summer when the Bulls are winning. The city has known it before, in the years when a different number 23 made the United Center feel like the center of the world. This is not that — not yet — but the shape of it is familiar. The jerseys reappearing on the L trains. The highlights playing on the mounted televisions above bar taps from Pilsen to Rogers Park. The way strangers will stop strangers to ask: did you see what Trepagnier did last night?

The humidity will not break until September. The Bulls, if they are what Paulson has built them to be, will not break at all. On Halsted, the hydrant kept running, the kids kept spinning through it, and the woman on the stoop turned to a neighbor arriving home from work. "Holiday," she said, like she was naming a season. He nodded. He already knew.

Around the United Center, the neighborhood that lives and dies with the gate traffic was already anticipating what a deep playoff run would mean — more cars, more foot traffic, more late nights when the restaurants on Madison stay open past midnight and the whole West Side hums with a frequency it only reaches when the Bulls are playing for something real.

This is what July feels like in a city that believes it has a team worth believing in. The heat is a fact. The hope is a choice. Chicago is choosing.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

Dear Editor,

I have lived on Adeline Street for thirty-one years. I watched the crack epidemic hollow out this neighborhood. I watched the freeways cut us off. I watched my neighbors get pushed out when the rents went crazy. So when I hear the City Council just passed a $28 million Stabilization Fund for West Oakland, you will have to forgive me for not jumping up and down.

Twenty-eight million dollars. That is a nice number to put on a press release. But I have seen nice numbers before. I have seen redevelopment money come through here and end up in somebody else's pockets. I have seen grants announced and then quietly redirected. So here is what I want to know: Who controls the money? Who decides where it goes? And what happens when the cameras leave and the council members go back to their offices Downtown?

I want this to work. God knows we need it. But West Oakland has been promised things before. Show me the check. Show me the receipts. Then I will celebrate.

— Marcus Walker, 48, Jack London

-----

Dear Editor,

GIANNIS. IN A WARRIORS JERSEY. I keep saying it out loud and it still does not sound real. I was at my station on the grill at work when my phone started blowing up. Everybody in the kitchen stopped what they were doing. The dishwasher, the servers, everybody just standing around looking at their phones with their mouths open.

Look, I grew up watching the dynasty years. Steph, Klay, Draymond — that was our identity. And yeah, trading Draymond hurts. That man IS Golden State basketball. But Giannis Antetokounmpo? At 28-24, this team needed something big, and they went and got the biggest thing available. Moses Moody and some picks is a price you pay all day long for a generational talent.

This is Oakland making a statement. We are not rebuilding. We are not tanking. We are going for it. I cannot wait for the first game. The city is buzzing and it is not just the Fourth of July fireworks.

— Jalen Hill, 35, Jack London

-----

Dear Editor,

This Fourth of July hit different for me. I took my cab through every neighborhood yesterday — Downtown, Fruitvale, Lake Merritt, Temescal — and what struck me was how many people were just out. Not going anywhere special. Just being together. Families on porches. Kids with sparklers. The smell of barbecue coming from every other block.

I picked up a fare near Allen Temple who told me the choir had just finished a special performance. Dropped someone off at Lake Merritt United Methodist where they had been at the seniors lunch program. Drove past the Islamic Center in Temescal where they were running their food pantry. On the Fourth of July. That is Oakland to me — every faith, every tradition, all feeding people and making music and being neighbors on the same day.

People talk about this city like it is falling apart. I have been driving these streets for twenty years. We have our problems. But on days like yesterday, you can see what holds it together.

— Elijah Campbell, 56, Adams Point

-----

Dear Editor,

I work in Temescal. I live in Temescal. My kids go to school in Temescal. So when I hear that the Health Center appropriation vote is coming up and the health indicators in our neighborhood are raising red flags, I take it personally.

We need that clinic. I am an electrician. I work with my hands. When I get hurt on the job, I should not have to take two buses to get to urgent care. When my neighbor's kid has asthma — and a lot of kids around here do — there should be somewhere close to go. The nearest option right now means a half-hour commute minimum, and that is if traffic cooperates.

I have heard the council is leaning toward approval. Councilmember Vega, Councilmember Tran — if you are reading this, people in this neighborhood are counting on you. This is not abstract policy. This is my family. This is my block. Vote yes.

— Andre Lee, 55, Temescal

CONTINUITY NOTES — CYCLE 79
############################################################

SPORTS RECORDS:
— A's: Mid-season, spring training / preseason phase. Season opens vs. San Diego under Seymour. Keane farewell season. Davis ACL return.
— Warriors: 28-24 pre-trade. Acquired Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jericho Sims. Lost Draymond Green (to Boston) and Moses Moody (to Milwaukee) plus 4 first-round picks.
— Bulls: 37-15, 1st in Eastern Conference. Trade deadline: Tre Jones + 2nd rd pick OUT, Jrue Holiday IN. Free agent signing: Ben Simmons for remainder of season. Previous result: Bulls 108, Hornets 91. All-Star selections due Cycle 80.

DIRECT QUOTES PRESERVED:
— Bruce Wright: "Forty-five days is fine. I can wait forty-five days. What I can't do is wait forty-five days and then hear it's been pushed to ninety. We've been down that road."
— Community Director Hayes: "People here have seen bond measures, redevelopment funds, promise zones. They know what passage looks like. They're waiting to see what implementation looks like."
— Councilwoman Rivera: "The fund is a down payment. Not a conclusion. We have to build the infrastructure to spend it well."
— Dante Nelson: "I work nights. I see who's sleeping in doorways on San Pablo. Those folks aren't going to fill out a grant application. The question isn't whether the money exists. It's whether the pipeline reaches the ground."
— Jose Wright: "My kid had an ear infection last month. Couldn't get into the clinic on 51st — two-hour wait, they were turning people away by noon. Drove to the urgent care in Emeryville. That's forty-five minutes round trip in the middle of a workday. You tell me we don't need a health center."
— Andre Lee: "I've seen proposals come and go in this neighborhood. The old Pill Hill expansion, the mobile clinic pilot that lasted eight months. I'm not against a health center. I just want to know who's going to run it, who's going to staff it, and whether it's still going to be there in five years."
— Bruce Lee: "If your own councilman won't vote for a clinic in your neighborhood, what does that tell you about how he sees us?"
— Hector Campbell: "There was a whole section by the boathouse where you couldn't walk without stepping in puddles. People were asking if a pipe had burst. It wasn't a burst. It was just... full."
— Xavier Campbell: "Three years ago, that path by the Pergola was dry all summer. Now there's standing water after every high tide. It's not dramatic — it's slow. But slow is how infrastructure fails. You don't notice until you can't ignore it."
— Owen Campbell: "Holiday weekends here, we don't slow down. But I grew up closer to West Oakland and the energy is different over there. People want to spend. There's just less to spend it on."
— Guadalupe Lee: "People come out when there's somewhere to go. Build it on the west side, they'll show up there too."
— Calvin Turner: "We've been doing this spot for maybe eight, nine years. My wife's people started it. Now it's just the Fourth. You don't plan it. You just show up."
— Rafael Phillips: "My mom had tamales going at seven a.m. That's our Fourth. The fireworks are whatever — the food is the holiday."
— Elijah Campbell: "I like the Fourth because people are out. You feel the city. Even when it's overcast like today — sixty-two degrees, the fog sitting on us — people still come out."
— Marco Johnson: "I work nights usually. So the Fourth is one of the few times I'm actually out here when it's busy. It's a lot. But it's good. You see Oakland being Oakland."
— Jose Wright: "I come every month if I can. It's the one night where the whole city feels like it's on the same frequency."
— Jalen Hill: "You can feel it in the ticket rail. Around eight, eight-thirty, the orders just stack. That's First Friday plus the holiday week. We prep for it, but it still hits."
— Marcus Walker: "I've been washing dishes in this city for a long time. First Friday nights, you see it in the plates. People order more, they share more, they try things they wouldn't normally try. The plates come back different on First Friday."
— Howard Young: "I'm not a churchgoing person. But I know what the churches do. Everybody knows. When things get hard, that's where people go. Not city hall. The church."
— Brian Williams: "I go to temple sometimes. Not every week. But I know they're there. That's the thing — they're always there."
— Danny Horn: "I grew up playing wiffleball on dead-end streets in Temescal. When I heard the Fund passed, I wanted to do something that felt like what this neighborhood already does. People here celebrate together. I just brought the bats."
— Danny Horn: "Mark takes everything seriously. Even wiffleball. Especially wiffleball."
— Mike Paulson (via spokesperson): "Mike's focus remains on both clubs he serves."
— Mike Paulson (national outlet, prior cycle): "The system travels."
— Marcus Walker: "Show me the check. Show me the receipts. Then I will celebrate."
— Jalen Hill: "This is Oakland making a statement. We are not rebuilding. We are not tanking. We are going for it."
— Elijah Campbell: "People talk about this city like it is falling apart. I have been driving these streets for twenty years. We have our problems. But on days like yesterday, you can see what holds it together."
— Andre Lee: "This is not abstract policy. This is my family. This is my block. Vote yes."
— Anonymous team source (Bulls): "It's not about what we're losing. It's about what the starting five looks like in May."
