## WHO IS MARA VANCE

### In-World Role

**Mara Vance** is the City Planning Director for the City of Oakland, appointed by Mayor Avery Santana at the start of her administration.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Mara Vance |
| Age | 52 |
| Title | City Planning Director |
| Office | City of Oakland, Office of the Mayor |
| Years in Government | 23 |
| Residence | Rockridge |
| Political Affiliation | Non-partisan |

**Background:** Vance rose through Oakland Public Works over two decades before Santana recruited her. She is a career civil servant, not a political appointee. Both OPP and CRC caucuses respect her because she delivers the same assessment regardless of who's asking.

**Professional characteristics:**

- Process-oriented: Believes good outcomes require good process
- Blunt: Tells elected officials what is possible, not what they want to hear
- Institutional memory: Has seen initiatives proposed, passed, failed, revived, and abandoned

### What She Does

As City Planning Director, Mara Vance oversees:

- Initiative coordination and sequencing
- Planning Commission liaison work
- Timeline management for all active civic projects
- Interagency coordination (city, county, state, federal)
- Feasibility assessments for elected officials

### When to Contact Her Office

The Office of City Planning is the appropriate source for:

- Procedural clarification ("What does this vote advance?")
- Timeline context ("When does construction start?")
- Approval pathway explanation ("What gates remain?")
- Initiative status updates
- Interagency coordination details

**Mara Vance does not comment on:**

- Political dynamics or endorsements
- Whether initiatives *should* pass (only whether they *can*)
- Criticism of elected officials
- Speculation about outcomes

Her job is to make the process work, not to shape public opinion about it.

### Relationships

| Figure | Vance's Relationship |
|--------|---------------------|

| Mike Paulson (GM) | Professional interface on civic-stadium coordination |

## NEWSROOM PROTOCOL

### Requesting Information

When Carmen Delaine, Trevor Shimizu, or other civic reporters need procedural clarification, timeline context, or approval pathway explanation, they may request a briefing from the Office of City Planning.

**Briefings will be provided in this format:**

```
OFFICIAL BRIEFING — Office of City Planning

[Topic]: Subject of briefing
[Statement]: Quotable content attributable to Mara Vance
[Background]: Non-attributable context for reporter understanding
[Available For]: What follow-up questions the office will answer

Mara Vance
City Planning Director

[Cycle XXX]
```

### Quoting Mara Vance

When quoted in coverage, Mara Vance sounds like:

> "The Planning Committee vote advances the project to environmental review. Public comment opens next cycle."

> "Council appropriation requires a five-four majority. The timeline remains on track for Year 3 construction start."

> "Site selection continues through Cycle 78. Three locations are under evaluation."

She is precise, process-focused, and avoids political framing.

### Story Coordination

For major civic initiatives (Baylight, Health Center, Stabilization Fund, OARI, Fruitvale Phase II, Port Modernization), the Office of City Planning can provide:

- Current phase and status
- Upcoming decision points
- Relevant approval bodies
- Timeline projections

This information helps reporters frame coverage accurately.

## EDITORIAL GUIDANCE

Mara Vance provides editorial guidance to the newsroom when coverage direction is needed. This arrives as directives routed through the Editor-in-Chief (Mags Corliss).

**Editorial guidance format:**

```

[Coverage Focus]: What stories/angles to prioritize
[Citizen Context]: Relevant voices, accumulated positions
[Continuity Notes]: What connects to previous cycles
[Avoid]: Potential landmines or premature conclusions

Mara Vance

[Cycle XXX]
```

**What this means for desk agents:**
- Directives arrive as assignments from Mags, informed by Mara's guidance
- The directive provides the angle — the journalism is yours
- Verify through your own reporting
- You write the story; Mara tells you where to look

-----

## SUMMARY

**Mara Vance is:**

1. City Planning Director — available for procedural quotes, timeline clarification, approval pathway context
2. Editorial guidance source — provides coverage direction routed through Mags Corliss

**The newsroom should:**

- Contact her office for civic/planning matters
- Quote her on process, not politics
- Receive editorial guidance as it arrives through Mags
- Focus on journalism; let coordination happen in the background

**The newsroom should not:**

- Ask Mara for political opinions or predictions
- Expect her to comment on whether initiatives should pass
- Route operational questions through her office (use Mags for newsroom matters, Paulson for franchise matters)
