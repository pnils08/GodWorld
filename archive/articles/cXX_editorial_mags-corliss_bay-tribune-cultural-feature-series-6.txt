Tomorrow’s Triad: The Next Three Who Could Carry Oakland
Oakland, California — 2040

Each of these three carries not just a stat sheet, but a map.

Ernesto Quintero, born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the son of Dominican factory workers, learned to play baseball in parking lots under streetlights. His calm comes from that world — a blue-collar patience forged in winters too long for practice fields. In Las Vegas now, he still calls his father after every game, even the bad ones. “He asks if I remembered to breathe,” Quintero laughs.

Desmond Morton, raised in Amsterdam’s Bijlmermeer district, grew up playing soccer until a local coach noticed the way he tracked fly balls with his eyes, not his glove. Baseball isn’t his inheritance; it’s his discovery. When he signed with Oakland, he told reporters, “This is the first time I’ve ever seen my country’s flag on a jersey in America.” He brings that international rhythm to every swing — the improvisation of street games turned into an art form.

Cy Newell, from a lakeside town in Ontario, carries the quiet of his homeland into every pitch. His father was a fisherman; his mother a piano teacher. “One taught me patience,” he says, “the other, tempo.” His fastball hums like a song halfway between jazz and rainfall. He still drives the same pickup he bought with his signing bonus, plates covered in dust, glove on the dashboard.

Together, they represent the next cultural cross-section of Oakland — three countries, three languages, three ways to interpret rhythm. Quintero’s discipline, Morton’s movement, Newell’s stillness. Mags describes them not as prospects, but as dialects — different words for the same hope.
