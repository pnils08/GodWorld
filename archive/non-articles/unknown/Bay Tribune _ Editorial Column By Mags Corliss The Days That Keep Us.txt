The Days That Keep Us
Oakland, California — April 2040
The city feels different in April, quieter in the best way.  The energy that roared on Opening Day has settled into something steadier — the hum of routine, the kind of comfort you only get when the noise turns into rhythm.  Walk down Telegraph Avenue on a Tuesday afternoon and you’ll hear it: radios drifting from storefronts, score updates traded like gossip, kids in Kelley jerseys cutting across the crosswalks before curfew.  The dynasty years built glory; these days build gratitude.
Henry Rivas starts every fifth game, and the fans already know his tempo.  By the second inning, they’ve matched it — conversations slow, vendors walk the aisles a little lighter.  Dillon follows him through the rotation, a left-handed metronome who doesn’t need to prove anything anymore.  Then comes John Ellis, the new arm with the calm face, reminding everyone that hope doesn’t always sound like shouting.  The crowd still stands for him in the sixth inning, not because he’s flawless, but because they remember what belief feels like.
The magic of this season isn’t in the standings; it’s in the small acts that keep it all alive.  Mark Aitken tossing a ball to a kid near first.  The old vendor singing between innings.  A young couple sitting with scorecards, teaching each other how to keep track the old way.  These are the days that keep us — the quiet ones that stretch between joy and routine, between memory and motion.
Oakland doesn’t rebuild; it renews.  That’s what this spring has shown us.  The same fans, the same skyline, the same cracked steps at the Coliseum — everything a little worn, everything still standing.  Baseball here isn’t about what we’ve won.  It’s about what we keep coming back for.  The noise between innings, the long evenings after wins and losses, the people who refuse to let go.  Those are the days that keep us.
