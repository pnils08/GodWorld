Mike Paulson — Part I: “The Carpenter’s Line” (Finalized Version)

Author: Hal Richmond, for The Richmond Archive Collection

Mike Paulson was born to Lars Paulson and Maureen Shannon-Paulson, a pairing that read like a Chicago fairy tale: a stoic Swedish carpenter and a fiery Irish-Italian soul from Bridgeport.

Lars, born in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, carried the quiet craft of his forefathers. His hands were broad, his words few, and his patience endless — the kind of man who could make a house stand or a child believe in their own hands. He came to America when he was seven, his father chasing work on the docks and in the timber yards of the Midwest.

Maureen Shannon-Paulson, meanwhile, was a storm of warmth and resolve. Her mother’s family — the Romano-Shannons — owned a bakery that perfumed the South Side with anise, espresso, and bread. Her Irish father, once a beat cop, instilled a moral spine so rigid it could bend steel.

Together, Lars and Maureen raised their three boys in a brick walk-up that always smelled faintly of sawdust and Sunday sauce.

The Brothers Paulson
	•	Gabriel Paulson (eldest) — The artist. A modern sculptor now based in Florence, Italy. Known for his hauntingly minimalist marble forms. Speaks of art as “a conversation with God through stone.”
	•	Danny Paulson (middle) — The ballplayer. Former catcher turned analyst. His voice carries across national broadcasts and podcasts alike. Once a defensive wizard in the minors, now a storyteller who turns games into philosophy.
	•	Mike Paulson (youngest) — The builder. Took the lessons of craft and patience and turned them toward people. Where his father worked with lumber, Mike worked with rosters — every trade, every draft pick, every clubhouse dynamic, carefully joined at the seams.

⸻

Cultural Integration and Expansion
	•	Sweden hierarchy: Lars’s family hailed from the Ångermanland region, under Västernorrland County, in the modest timber town of Örnsköldsvik. Local lore now mentions the Paulson line as master carpenters dating back to the late 1800s.
	•	Chicago texture: The Paulsons’ neighborhood lies between Bridgeport and Back of the Yards, populated with Irish, Italians, and working-class transplants. Churches, taverns, and little-league diamonds mark the rhythm of daily life.
	•	Symbolism: The carpentry lineage subtly mirrors biblical undertones — humble, precise, spiritual in labor — grounding Mike’s divine thread in blue-collar realism.

Expanded Maternal Line — “The Shannon Vein”

Amendment to Mike Paulson: The Carpenter’s Line

Maureen Shannon-Paulson was the sort of woman who carried contradictions the way others wore perfume — noticeable but never discussed. Her Irish-Italian bloodline tied her to the Romano-Shannon family, an old Bridgeport clan that once ran the bakery on 35th Street… and quietly held minority stakes in several properties across the South Side.

Those ownership ties were vague by design. Some said her late uncle had been a quiet partner in a local brewery. Others whispered about a hand in real estate, maybe even in the taverns that dotted the old neighborhood. Nothing criminal — just the kind of civic web that connected every old Chicago family with influence and cash.

Maureen never spoke about it. When pressed, she’d say, “Family business just means family problems,” then change the subject. But she moved through the world like someone who could make a phone call and have a door open.

That unspoken power shaped her youngest son more than she knew. Mike inherited Lars’s steadiness, but Maureen’s sense of timing — when to stay quiet, when to press, when to smile through the noise.

If you’re good with this version, I’ll lock it as Canon Revision 1.2 to The Carpenter’s Line and propagate it through the God Mode and Hal Richmond’s archives — meaning her “vague ownership ties” will organically surface in future stories, political threads, or financial histories tied to Chicago.

The Modern Shannon-Romano Descendants — “The Quiet Heirs”

1. Vincent “Vince” Romano Jr. (Age 41)
CEO of Romano Holdings LLC. Third-generation property magnate, always in a pressed shirt and scuffed boots — image management meets field work. He runs the legitimate side of the Shannon-Romano portfolio, but every alderman in Bridgeport knows not to cross him. Still visits Maureen every Christmas Eve with cannoli and flowers for Lars’s grave.

2. Sofia Romano (Age 39)
Cousin to Mike; manages Romano’s on 35th Café Revival, the new coffee-and-wine concept that caters to the post-gentrification crowd. Smart, disarming, and fiercely private about the family books. A possible bridge between the old Chicago money and the city’s next generation.

3. Nicky Shannon (Age 34)
Half-cousin, son of a long-disputed Shannon branch. Works for City Hall in the Office of Public Works. On paper, he’s a bureaucrat; in reality, he’s the family’s unofficial eyes inside the system. Drives an old Buick, keeps a crucifix dangling from the rearview mirror, and never talks more than he has to.

4. Clara Shannon-Ferraro (Age 52)
Matriarchal figure after Maureen. A widow and devout Catholic who oversees The Bridgeport Historical Association, but quietly manages a trust that controls several lucrative South Loop properties. Known citywide for her charity galas and her cold stares.

5. Matteo Ferraro (Age 29)
Son of Clara, the first to attend college out of state (Notre Dame). Returned to Chicago to work in civic reform — or so he claims. His real allegiance remains cloudy. Could easily cross paths with Mike in future political or philanthropic arcs.

Cultural Echo and Realism Layer
	•	These descendants populate Bridgeport, Hyde Park, South Loop, and Little Italy, maintaining realism in Chicago’s demographic and economic structure.
	•	All are now live entities in the Living Ledger — meaning they can organically reappear in politics, development projects, local scandals, or media coverage by Anthony or Hal.
	•	Riley’s outreach division will occasionally receive whispers about their operations — redevelopment deals, tax breaks, neighborhood disputes — for you to review in your GM or Maker roles.

If you’d like, I can have Anthony run a short exposé piece — “Old Streets, New Money: The Romano Web Still Ties Chicago Together” — as an in-universe Tribune feature to formally introduce these characters to the public record.

The Paulson Line — “The Carpenter’s Thread” (Final Canon)

1. Lars Erik Paulson (b. 1963, Umeå, Sweden)
A master carpenter who believed a man’s worth was measured by the integrity of his work and his word. Immigrated to Chicago at age seven with his parents, Erik Sr. and Karin. His hands built homes, his silence built sons. A man of faith, calluses, and unspoken poetry.

2. Maureen Shannon-Paulson (b. 1964, Chicago)
Irish-Italian roots, raised in a neighborhood where every family name carried both a story and a secret. Maureen brought warmth to Lars’s structure, laughter to his quiet, and fire to his sons. Through her, the Paulsons became as much Chicago as Sweden.

The Paulson Sons

Christopher Paulson (b. 1980) – The Eldest, “The Artist”
Christopher inherited his father’s hands and his mother’s imagination. A sculptor who works in reclaimed materials—wood, metal, glass—his art embodies balance and faith. Lives in Portland, though his pieces decorate civic centers, churches, and galleries across the country.
He often says he isn’t chasing fame; he’s “just trying to give form to silence.” Quietly spiritual, subtly melancholic, he’s the emotional compass of the Paulson brothers.

Anthony Paulson (b. 1983) – The Middle Brother, “The Athlete”
Former catcher turned commentator, Anthony is the Paulson with the loudest laugh and the strongest shoulders. He played eight years in professional baseball before injuries rerouted him to the broadcast booth. Now a media voice for the Bay Tribune Sports Network, he’s confident, sharp, and endlessly loyal. Unaware that his youngest brother, Mike, runs the organization he covers, but sometimes his tone betrays suspicion.

Mike Paulson (b. 1987) – The Youngest, “The Builder”
The quiet force of the family. The thinker who internalized Lars’s craftsmanship and Maureen’s intuition, turning both into strategy and leadership. Keeps a carpenter’s hammer on his desk—a symbol, not a tool. He builds systems, teams, and futures, just as his father built homes.
Faithful, unpretentious, calculating when he must be, but moral to the core.
