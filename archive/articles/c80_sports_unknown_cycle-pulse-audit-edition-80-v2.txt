CYCLE PULSE AUDIT — EDITION 80 v2

============================================================

TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE: FAIL

- Header missing temperature and week number
- Business Ticker prose instead of structured fields

CHARACTER VERIFICATION: FAIL

- Councilwoman Rivera — phantom, not in any ledger or source document
- Community Director Hayes — phantom, no first name, no POP-ID, third cycle running

VOTE MATH & POLITICAL FACTS: FAIL

- Engine output 6-2. Agents wrote 5-4. Engine is source of truth. If only two voted NO, the entire Ashford-against-his-district story may be wrong.

JOURNALIST BEAT COMPLIANCE: PASS

FOURTH WALL INTEGRITY: PASS

NARRATIVE CONTINUITY: FAIL

- Wiffleball “moved from West Oakland to Temescal” — C79v2 already covered it as a completed event in West Oakland. Can’t move what already happened.
- Stabilization Fund dominates four sections. Health Center is the C80 event and gets half of one article.
