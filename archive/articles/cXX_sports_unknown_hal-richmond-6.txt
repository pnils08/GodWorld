Part VII — Martin Richards and the Legacy of Oakland’s Corner Sluggers

Oakland’s great corner infielders always arrived with a certain weight on their shoulders. Jason Giambi carried the early 2000s on his back, winning an MVP while dragging a team into contention. Miguel Tejada followed with an MVP of his own, powering the A’s through an era defined by violence at the plate and pressure in every pennant race. Those players didn’t simply hit baseballs — they changed the shape of innings.

Martin Richards belongs in that lineage, even if he arrived through a quieter door.

His peak seasons do not scream in neon the way Giambi’s thunderclaps did, nor do they dance with the same reckless rhythm Tejada thrived on. But when you study the numbers, the consistency, the impact, the parallels start to reveal themselves — not in noise, but in structure.

Take his 2036 season, the first sign that Oakland had drafted more than a steady contributor:

150 games
604 at-bats
188 hits
38 doubles
30 home runs
84 RBI
.311 average
.390 on-base percentage
.523 slugging percentage

That is an anchor season. Not a superstar’s spike, not a lucky run — an anchor. A true middle-of-the-order stabilizer. Oakland’s offense doesn’t function without those seasons, and dynasties do not survive through chaos without hitters like this holding the calendar steady.

But what separates Richards from the typical contact hitter turned power threat is what he did after the breakout. The follow-up years were not regression — they were refinement.

2037: .272/.364/.437
2038: .289/.380/.498, 30 home runs
2039: .302/.379/.514 in 90 games

The 2038 season, especially, is the one that echoes the old era the loudest. Thirty home runs and seventy-two RBI with a near-.380 on-base percentage is the kind of line Giambi used to normalize. It’s the kind of season that makes a lineup deeper by default and makes pitchers wonder why they can’t get him out in big spots.

Richards doesn’t profile like the sluggers before him. Giambi was a force of nature. Tejada was fire wearing cleats. Richards plays more like a scalpel — precise, patient, and quietly punishing. His left-handed swing doesn’t chase violence. It finds it. His doubles power is a shape the early-2000s teams never had. His consistency is something those teams always needed.

What ties him to the lineage isn’t the raw power or the theatrics. It’s the reliability. The ability to give Oakland an identity at the corner infield spot — year after year, inning after inning. This franchise has always been strongest when someone in the three or four hole carried the heartbeat. Giambi did it. Tejada did it. Now Richards does it in a different language.

The dynasty doesn’t ask him to be a savior.
It asks him to be inevitable.
And in a lineup full of storms, Richards is the shape of the weather.
