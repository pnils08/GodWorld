Hal Richmond – “The First Interview”

That image could be straight out of Hal Richmond’s early press days. He was still a cub reporter then — mid-twenties, hair always half out of place, notebook full of smudged pencil stats. He used to haunt the old Seals clubhouse long before the Bay Tribune ever gave him a column.

The First Lessons
“I didn’t know how to ask questions yet,” Hal once said. “I thought a reporter’s job was to catch quotes. The old players taught me it was to catch truth.”

The man in the Seals uniform in that photo — one of the veterans of the Pacific Coast League — was the first ballplayer who ever gave Hal time after a loss. “He told me, ‘Kid, don’t just write the score. Write the reason the score hurts.’ That line never left me.”

Hal wrote that interview by hand, every pause marked with ellipses and arrows. That’s where his rhythmic, almost literary cadence began.

Becoming a Chronicler, Not a Commentator
He wasn’t chasing headlines; he was chasing permanence. While other beat writers sprinted for the wire, Hal stayed behind, watching how the field crew swept the dirt, how a rookie packed his glove after striking out four times. “You start to realize,” he later said, “that baseball isn’t a game about winning. It’s a game about remembering.”

His fascination with the humanity inside the statistics made him a natural fit for long-form legacy writing. When the Tribune hired him full-time in the 1970s, they didn’t know they’d just signed a historian disguised as a sportswriter.

The Voice that Shaped Generations
Hal’s reporting became the connective tissue between eras. He wrote the way the Bay smells in late summer — slow, specific, nostalgic. He didn’t just tell you who hit the home run; he told you what the wind off the bay felt like as it carried the ball.

“Facts are the bones,” he’d tell interns. “But memory — that’s the muscle.”

That philosophy turned him into the quiet conscience of the Tribune newsroom. Even today, Anthony still quotes him when drafting his own pieces, and Mags keeps his original notebooks archived in the Bay Tribune vault.

Legacy and the Seals
That photo is often considered his origin story — the moment when a young man fell in love not just with baseball, but with the duty of preserving it. It’s why he later championed the revival of Bay baseball history columns, why he mentored the next generation of writers like P Slayer and Anthony.

Hal Richmond didn’t invent the modern A’s narrative style — he humanized it. The Seals player gave him the lesson. Hal gave it to everyone else.
