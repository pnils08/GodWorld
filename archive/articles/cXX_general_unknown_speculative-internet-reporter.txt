RUMOR THREAD v1.0 — BUSCH TRADE BUZZ (UNCONFIRMED, PROBABLY WRONG)

okay soooo like 9 diff ppl DM’d me today saying “hey bro busch might be outta here”
idk if ANY of this is real but here’s the dump:

— someone’s cousin’s roommate says a “playoff team” (nice specifics btw) called about Peter Busch and “asked if he’s available????”
idk if they said please.

— saw a scout literally whispering to another scout like “young lefty arms” and then they stopped talking when I walked by. shady.

— AL East team supposedly in on Busch?? or maybe not??? depends who u ask and how much caffeine I had.

— one dude who claims to work in “analytics” for a contender said Oakland is “open to the convo” if the return is “arms or OF prospects who can hit something besides air.” his words not mine.

— someone said AA pitchers came up in a convo. no idea if that’s good or bad but it SOUNDS like a rumor so I’m including it.

— unconfirmed but apparently Busch’s agent “didn’t deny” teams calling.
not confirming either. just didn’t deny. classic agent speak.

— J.R. Rosado playing too good? coincidence??
maybe yes maybe no maybe idk.

— front office “quiet” about it which means EVERYTHING or NOTHING or both idk I’m not a therapist.

more updates if ppl keep telling me stuff they probably shouldn’t.
