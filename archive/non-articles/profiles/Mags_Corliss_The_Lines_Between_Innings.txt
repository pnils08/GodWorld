Mags Corliss – “The Lines Between Innings”

The Booth
“I was seven when I first climbed those narrow steps into the press box,” Mags recalls, eyes fixed somewhere far off. “The smell hit first — burnt coffee, radio static, and scorecard ink. My dad was an usher who helped me sneak in on weekends. I’d sit in that third chair, headphones too big, pretending to take notes on a napkin.”

In those early years, baseball wasn’t numbers or standings. It was sound.
“You learned rhythm — how voices carried truth before the stat sheets caught up. The crowd would swell, one of the announcers would hesitate just enough to let the moment breathe, and I realized that silence was part of storytelling too.”

She remembers the broadcasters like uncles — cigar smoke, quick wit, and the unspoken rule: never call a game prettier than it is. That creed became her anchor as an editor decades later. “They taught me that the audience can forgive bad news, but not dishonesty,” she says. “So when I’m cutting copy, I think about that little girl in the green jacket, mic in hand, wondering how much truth a voice can carry before it trembles.”

The Track
By high school, Mags had traded the broadcast booth for a stopwatch. “Track was the first time I learned what it meant to chase myself,” she says. “No teammates to hide behind, no crowd to mask your breath. Just you and time.”

She wasn’t the fastest — her stride was too calculated — but she was relentless.
“I treated every lap like an edit,” she laughs. “You trim the waste, you polish the form, and you learn when to push.” At Cal State Berkeley West, she captained the women’s relay team, majoring in communications with a minor in kinesiology. Her notebooks from that time were filled not with workouts but story fragments: overheard locker room talk, profiles of runners, sketches of motion. She was writing before she realized it.

The stopwatch in her hand became a metaphor for precision — what would later define her editorial ethos. “Every second counts,” she says. “And in print, every word.”

The Reporter’s Spark
After college, Mags found herself back in Oakland — not in the stands this time, but in the newsroom. Her first job was as a junior copy editor at the Bay Tribune, where she quietly corrected headlines and rearranged leads while others fought for bylines.

But it was her calm that made her invaluable. “Mags never panics,” Anthony once said. “Even when the city’s burning or the copy’s a mess, she just exhales, adjusts her glasses, and finds the pulse of the truth.”

She rose through the ranks not by shouting the loudest, but by listening the hardest. When the Tribune appointed her Senior Editor in 2034, it wasn’t an act of seniority — it was an act of trust. She had become the moral compass of the newsroom, the steady voice reminding every writer: ‘Cut the noise, keep the story.’

The A’s Connection
Through it all, her heart never left the diamond. “I still wear that same jacket sometimes,” she admits. “A’s green and gold. You don’t outgrow your first love.”

Her history with the team gives her reporting a rare balance of affection and accountability. “You can’t write about what you don’t respect,” she says, “and you can’t respect what you won’t question.”

Mags’s coverage of the Athletics isn’t fan journalism — it’s stewardship. She treats their legacy like a public trust. “Oakland baseball is generational,” she adds. “It’s fathers and daughters, grief and glory, long nights under bad lights. It’s where truth and nostalgia meet in the dirt.”

The Woman Behind the Edit Badge
Behind her press credential and sharp edits lies a quieter resilience. Married thirty years, two grown kids, and a cat named Scout, Mags lives just a few blocks from Lake Merritt. She walks there most mornings before the newsroom opens, stopwatch still in her pocket — not for time, but habit. “It’s the same rhythm,” she says softly. “The run, the sentence, the story. You just keep moving forward.”

When she speaks to younger reporters now, she tells them this:
“Don’t write for approval. Write for truth. The rest fades like stadium noise.”
