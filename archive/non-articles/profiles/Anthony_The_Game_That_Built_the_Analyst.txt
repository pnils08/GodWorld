Anthony – “The Game That Built the Analyst”

“Yeah, that’s me,” Anthony says, looking at the photo. “Berkeley Owls. Summer heat, dusty infields, and a bat that felt about twice as big as I was.”

He taps the picture like he’s back in the dugout.

“I was a full scholarship kid. People hear that and think it was all talent. It wasn’t. It was obsession. I loved baseball more than I was good at baseball. That’s the truth. I wasn’t the five-tool monster. I was the kid who wanted to know why the ball carried better to right on humid days. I was the kid charting pitches in high school. I was the kid asking the assistant coach for spray charts when everybody else was asking for new batting gloves.”

The scholarship years
“Scholarship ball teaches you two things real quick: one, nobody cares that you were the best player in your zip code. Two, the game is cruel but fair if you pay attention.

“I played outfield and a little corner infield. I could run, I could throw, but what actually kept me on the field was knowing where to be. I liked studying hitters. I liked knowing that this guy rolled over on off-speed, and this guy stayed back, and this guy never hit the ball in the air on the first pitch. Coaches love players who make them look smart. I became that player.”

He smiles. “That right there is where the reporter was born. People think I just showed up in Oakland and started writing. No. I was already cataloging people. Habits. Flaws. Patterns. It is the same muscle.”

Love first, numbers second
“Look, I didn’t get into baseball because of analytics. I got into analytics because of baseball.

“I loved the game so much that the normal fan experience wasn’t enough. I didn’t just want to cheer. I wanted to understand. Why does this pitcher with worse stuff get better results? Why does this lineup score more with fewer big names? Why does this catcher make pitchers better? You start asking those questions and suddenly you’re neck deep in hard contact rate, framing metrics, expected batting average, swing decisions, sequencing.

“And once you see what the numbers reveal, you can’t unsee it. You start realizing winning isn’t luck. It’s accumulation of tiny, boring, repeatable edges. That’s reporting, man. Take the boring thing and make it visible.”

From player to analyst
He points to the photo again. “That kid right there thought he was going to the show. Every kid does. Then you meet the real dudes and you realize, okay, maybe the big leagues are not in the cards. So what do you do? You stay close to the game in the way you’re actually elite.

“For me that was observation. I could see the game. I could explain it. And I could do it without needing to be the star. That’s why I’m a reporter and not a radio clown. I write so the fan who thinks the A’s just ‘magically’ win can see, no, this is structure. This is roster building. This is development. This is cap discipline. This is an organization doing math on human beings.”

He shrugs. “Somebody’s got to tell that part.”

Why he’s so blunt now
“You ever wonder why I don’t sugarcoat stuff?” he says. “Because scholarship ball doesn’t let you lie. If you’re hitting .212, you’re hitting .212. If you missed the cutoff, you missed the cutoff. You can smile, you can say the vibes are good, but the chart says you’re late. That never left me.

“So when I cover Oakland, I cover them like a coach reading a chart. I give credit. I call out waste. I don’t get caught up in ‘we love this guy’ if the data says he’s falling off. That’s not being cold. That’s being faithful to the game.”

Why he stayed in Oakland
“I could’ve chased a national job,” he admits. “But Oakland was the right lab. It was the perfect place for a converted player who liked to measure things.

“Because the A’s are proof that you can compete without being the richest kid in the room. You have to know where value hides. That’s catnip for a guy like me. I love stories where the smart people win. I love stories where development matters. I love stories where a kid from Mississippi or Ohio shows up and becomes a six-time champ because a front office actually knew what it was looking at.

“That’s why I like writing alongside Hal and putting up with P Slayer’s heat. We all love the same thing, just from different angles.”

Final line
“So yeah,” he says, looking at the photo one more time, “that was the first version of me. The kid who loved the game enough to study it. Reporter me is just player me with a laptop instead of a glove. Same eye. Same hunger. And I still keep score by hand, because the game deserves to be seen, not just streamed.”

That kid in the Berkeley Owls jersey didn’t fail. He just changed positions.
