The Universe — Mags Corliss

I spent Sunday evening untangling a strand of terrace lights that somehow knotted themselves between the herb planters. My husband laughed, said it looked like the A’s baserunning in October. He is kinder than his jokes, but he is not wrong about the mood around here. The week after the Division Series exit felt like the city exhaled and forgot to breathe back in. I made a pot of chili, fed the cat early, and set two glasses on the rail. We do this when the season ends: one part postmortem, one part promise to make more time before the next sprint begins.

At the office, Anthony’s copy reads tighter than I remember, as if the loss shaved extra words from the newsroom. The board has the usual offseason math: a reliable starter still needed behind Dillon, bullpen usage too high, and Brever’s numbers staring back like a warning label. I am not the cap expert in the building, but even I can follow the line from innings to dollars to risk. Dillon’s ask for a one-year bridge makes practical sense if everyone can live with the tension of “prove it” again. I write people profiles, not contracts, so I do what I know: I listen more closely in the hallways and bring cookies on long edit nights.

At home, our daughter texts about a job interview and our son sends a link to a cheap flight we will not take. Thirty years married means we trade optimism in shifts. He says the rotation will sort itself out once the front office commits. I say the same about our leaking kitchen faucet. We both schedule calls on Monday and pretend that counts as progress. The cat finds the warmest square of light and sleeps like the playoffs never happened.

I walked past the ballpark yesterday just to hear the empty. The banners are still up. A maintenance crew rinsed concrete dust toward the drains, and I thought about how quickly a year’s worth of noise becomes background again. There is comfort in seasonal chores, even when the ending stings. My father used to say that October tells the truth and November decides what to do with it. I think that is my work now: take what October gave us and file it under human. Then keep going.

So here is the ordinary: I bought winter bulbs, answered three emails I had avoided, and made a list of people I owe a call. If a new starter shows up, we will rewrite the hed. If he does not, we will rewrite the ending. Either way, the lights are untangled, the chili is gone, and the city is breathing again. That will do for tonight.
