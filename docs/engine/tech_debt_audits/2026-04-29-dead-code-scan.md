# Dead-Code Detection Scan — 2026-04-29

S185 engine-sheet. Closes the S156 deferred dead-code item (Path 1 audit §WARNINGS / Dead-code detection). Full unreferenced-function scan across 143 engine files with allowlist for Apps Script triggers, string-dispatch, and bare-named entry points.

---

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files scanned | 143 (phase01-11 + utilities) |
| Function declarations | 909 |
| Unique function names | 884 |
| **Unreferenced (no callers)** | **74** |
| Allowlisted (manual entry points / Apps Script triggers) | 19 |

Of the 74 unreferenced:
- **KEEP** as standby/scaffold: 46 (writeIntents standby 3 + manual entry 1 + transit 8 + crime 6 + faith 5 + youth 5 + rosterLookup 4 + bondEngine rivalry 2 + story signals 3 + bondPersistence 3 + civic helpers 2 + weather 2 + neighborhood demographics 2)
- **DELETE** candidates: 20 (v2DeprecationGuide 5 + persistenceExecutor bridges 3 + parseMediaRoomMarkdown sub-helpers 3 + cycleModes timing 3 + eventArcEngine internals 3 + mediaRoomIntake setup 2 + nextPopIdSafe_ 1)
- **Uncategorized in this audit pass: 8** — scattered single-function unrefs across `phase06-analysis/updateStorylineStatusv1.2.js`, `phase07-evening-media/mediaFeedbackEngine.js`, `phase09-digest/applyCycleWeight.js`, `phase11-media-intake/healthCauseIntake.js`, `utilities/ensureRelationshipBonds.js`, `utilities/exportCitizensSnapshot.js`, `utilities/sheetNames.js`, `utilities/utilityFunctions.js`. Defer to next audit pass — each needs individual review before delete-or-keep.

**S185 update post-DELETE-batch:** All 20 DELETE candidates removed and clasp-deployed. Scan re-ran 74 → 56 unreferenced (net -18; 2 new transitive unrefs surfaced where deleted functions were the sole callers — candidates for next audit pass).

---

## Methodology

`scripts/scanDeadCode.js` walks all `.js` files under engine phase directories + utilities. For each `^function NAME(` declaration, counts whole-word references across `phase*/`, `utilities/`, `scripts/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `lib/` (`.js`, `.md`, `.json`). If references = definition count (no callers beyond the def site itself), function is flagged.

**Allowlist applied:**
1. Apps Script trigger names (`onOpen`, `onEdit`, `onSelectionChange`, `onInstall`, `onFormSubmit`, `doGet`, `doPost`).
2. Functions referenced by string literal (`'NAME'` or `"NAME"`) — covers menu-`addItem`, dispatch-by-name, config-driven invocation.
3. Bare-named functions (no trailing underscore) — Apps Script convention for public entry points; treated as likely menu/trigger callbacks.

**Limitations:**
- Does not catch reflection/`eval`/dynamic dispatch beyond string literals.
- Does not catch references inside compiled bundles or non-tracked files.
- TypeScript / non-`.js` extension files not scanned.

## KEEP — Standby APIs (built S184/S185, awaiting first caller)

These are infrastructure functions shipped recently as part of in-progress work. Removing them would un-ship work that's already landed.

| Function | File | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|
| `queueEnsureTabIntent_` | utilities/writeIntents.js:239 | Phase 42 B0 deliverable (S184); awaiting redesign batch + intake migrations |
| `queueLogIntent_` | utilities/writeIntents.js:265 | Public intent-API helper for log-priority writes |
| `getIntentsForSheet_` | utilities/writeIntents.js:287 | Public inspection helper for intent-system debugging |

---

## KEEP — Manual / debug entry points

Functions that exist to be invoked by hand (test scaffolding, one-shot diagnostics).

## KEEP — Planned-feature scaffold (referenced in roadmap docs)

Functions documented in `docs/archive/ENGINE_ROADMAP.md`, `ENGINE_STUB_MAP.md`, or `SESSION_HISTORY.md` as intended for downstream consumers that haven't shipped. Removing now means re-scaffolding when the consumer lands.

## DELETE candidates (true dead code)

Functions with no callers, no roadmap references, no public-API role. Safe to remove.

| `cleanSubsectionName_` | 728 |
| `parseNoteLine_` | 734 |

### Phase timing helpers (3) — `utilities/cycleModes.js`

|----------|------|
| `startPhaseTimer_` | 394 |
| `endPhaseTimer_` | 408 |
| `getPhaseTimingSummary_` | 427 |

### Event arc engine sub-functions (3) — `phase04-events/eventArcEngine.js`

| Function | Line |
|----------|------|
| `generateNewArcs_` | 430 |
| `attachCitizenToArc_` | 810 |
| `getArcEventBoost_` | 857 |

### Media intake setup helpers (2) — `phase07-evening-media/mediaRoomIntake.js`

| `ensurePressDraftsSheet_` | 750 |

### Misc (1)

## REVIEW — Judgment call (keep or delete TBD)

These need a closer human read before action. Listing for the next pass.

| Function | File | Line | Question |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| (no entries this pass) | — | — | — |

Note: all 74 unreferenced functions were placed into KEEP or DELETE. The REVIEW bucket is empty for this audit; future scans may need it for ambiguous cases.

---

## Recommended actions

1. **Delete the 31 DELETE candidates** in a single commit per file (or one bundled commit). Total LOC removed: ~estimate 800-1200 lines (varies). Apps Script side: clasp push deploys the file shrinkage.
2. **Annotate the 38 KEEP candidates** with `// SCAFFOLD: awaits <consumer>` comments at the def site so future scans don't re-flag them. (Optional polish.)
3. **Re-run `scripts/scanDeadCode.js`** after the next major engine session to detect new accumulation. Recommend adding to the `/tech-debt-audit` skill chain at the next refresh.

## Raw output

Full JSON: `output/dead-code-scan-2026-04-29.json` (gitignored).

Re-run: `node scripts/scanDeadCode.js`

## Closes

- ROLLOUT_PLAN "NEW AUDIT: Dead-code detection scan" entry (S156, MEDIUM).
- Defers DELETE-batch execution to a separate engine-sheet session — this audit is the verdict, not the action.
