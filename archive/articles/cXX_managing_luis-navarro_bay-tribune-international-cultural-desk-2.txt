Bay Tribune — International & Cultural Desk
By Luis Navarro
Finding Home Between the Lines
Oakland, California — 2040

When I first stepped into the Bay Tribune newsroom, I didn’t know if my Spanish would survive here. 
It was 2032, and Oakland felt like an orchestra already playing — rhythm, sound, chaos — and I was the new 
instrument trying to find its note. I’d come from Guadalajara, from newsrooms that smelled like coffee 
and deadline ink, where stories were shouted over one another in two languages. Baseball was my first 
English word, and still the one that feels most honest in both tongues.

Covering the A’s has become a kind of translation. I watch Dominican rookies search for Wi-Fi 
signals strong enough to FaceTime their mothers. I see Japanese relievers eating tacos for the first time. 
I hear a dozen accents collide in the clubhouse, and somehow it all becomes one language — 
competition. That’s the poetry of this city; everyone’s accent belongs here.

Oakland taught me that the game isn’t just a sport, it’s a declaration. The bleachers sound like 
choruses, each voice carrying its own country. I learned quickly that reporting here isn’t about 
box scores; it’s about context. It’s about how a home run in June can make someone’s father in 
Santo Domingo believe his son is going to be okay. It’s about the quiet conversations between 
players who don’t share a language but share the same exhaustion.

When I write, I write for the cousins still watching from afar. For the fans who don’t have cable but 
have faith. For the families that send prayers across time zones disguised as WhatsApp messages. 
I write in English, but every sentence has a Spanish heartbeat.

This column is my handshake to Oakland — to its noise, to its grace, to the way it makes room for 
every language at once. If baseball is the city’s religion, then journalism is its echo, and I’m grateful 
to have found mine here.
