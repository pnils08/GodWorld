The Oakland Stack

Four anchor tenants, five homegrown firms, and the infrastructure play that turned a waterfront district into a company town

By Celeste Tran | Bay Tribune Social Trends

---

Between June 1st and August 15th, Oakland's Commercial Business Registry logged forty-seven new LLC filings with declared sectors in artificial intelligence, cloud services, or applied data systems. Forty-seven in eleven weeks. For context, the same filing window in 2039 produced nineteen. In 2037 — the year before the A's fourth championship and the year Baylight District was still a remediation study — the number was eight.

That's not a trend line. That's a relocation pattern.

Oakland in August 2041 has a tech ecosystem. Not the venture-capital fever dream version — not the kind where a billionaire buys a neighborhood and renames it. The quieter kind. The kind where four anchor companies establish offices, a handful of Oakland-native firms grow up around them, and by the time anyone writes the landscape piece, the landscape is already built. This is that piece. I'm late. The stack is already here.

Start at the base layer.

Anthropic occupies three floors of the old Schnitzer Steel building at the foot of Jack London Square — a conversion completed in late 2039 that kept the original loading dock facade and put an AI governance research lab behind it. Their Oakland office focuses on policy-facing work: safety frameworks, municipal AI auditing standards, and — since the OARI vote — consultation on the alternative response system's decision architecture. They are not building the city's emergency dispatch. They are advising the people who are building it on how not to build it wrong. The distinction matters. Approximately two hundred and forty employees, mostly research and policy staff, with a satellite hiring pipeline that pulls from Mills College's computational ethics program.

DigitalOcean runs its West Coast infrastructure operations out of a campus on Embarcadero West, six blocks from the Baylight construction perimeter. Cloud hosting, managed databases, and — increasingly — the backend for Oakland's own civic digital services. The city's 311 system, the OARI dispatch prototype, and the Baylight Authority's construction monitoring dashboard all run on DigitalOcean infrastructure. When Director Keisha Ramos says the Authority is evaluating fiber-optic backbone vendors and distributed energy monitoring systems, the evaluation is happening on servers three miles from the construction site. That proximity is not an accident. Around three hundred employees, heavy on operations engineering.

Discord opened its Oakland community office in 2040, in a converted warehouse space in Uptown on Telegraph near 19th. Smaller footprint — roughly ninety staff — focused on civic engagement tooling. Oakland's neighborhood association forums, the Temescal community board, and the real-time public comment system used during the Baylight council sessions all run on Discord's civic platform layer. They are quiet about it. They do not sponsor the A's. They do not have a logo on the waterfront. But every resident who typed a comment during the 6-3 bond vote did it on Discord infrastructure.

Moltbook is the newest arrival and the hardest to explain to someone who doesn't work in agent systems. Agent-to-agent communication protocols — the plumbing that lets AI systems talk to each other without a human relay. Their Oakland office is in Adams Point, a small team of about sixty, and their relevance to the city is less about what they sell and more about what they enable. When Anthropic's governance models need to coordinate with DigitalOcean's infrastructure monitoring, Moltbook is the wire between them. In a city running five simultaneous civic mega-projects, inter-system communication is not theoretical. It's load-bearing.

Those are the anchors. Four companies, roughly seven hundred employees, occupying space from Jack London to Adams Point. The real estate footprint alone represents an estimated $14 million in annual commercial lease revenue. But the anchors are only the visible layer. Underneath them — or beside them, or sometimes funding them — are the Oakland-native firms that grew up in the spaces the anchors left open.

Ridgeline Ventures is the one you need to know first, because Ridgeline is the money.

Founded in 2036 by Priya Chandrasekaran, a former Kleiner Perkins associate who left Sand Hill Road because she got tired of funding companies that treated the East Bay as a commute. Ridgeline operates out of a converted Victorian on Grand Avenue in Lake Merritt, four partners, a $220 million fund, and an investment thesis that can be stated in one sentence: Oakland infrastructure plays only. They don't fund consumer apps. They don't fund social media. They fund companies whose revenue depends on Oakland working — on the transit running, the buildings going up, the civic systems functioning. Their portfolio includes early-stage positions in at least two of the companies on this list. When Mayor Santana says "we need private sector partners, starting with the technology companies that have been testing Oakland as a market," he is describing Ridgeline's entire strategy. They tested Oakland as a market. They stayed.

Gridiron Analytics is the sports data firm that everyone in the A's front office pretends they don't rely on. Founded in 2038 by two former Stanford statistics PhDs — Daniel Yoon and Christine Nakamura — who built predictive models for player development and in-game strategy. Based in a co-working space above a Temescal coffee shop on Telegraph, eleven employees, revenue coming primarily from consulting contracts with three MLB organizations including the A's. Six championships generate economic gravity. Gridiron exists because the A's exist, because the dynasty created a market for the analytical infrastructure that sustains it. Yoon has said publicly that the company would not have located anywhere else. The data walks in from the Coliseum. You want to be close enough to smell the grass.

Oakmesh Systems fills the gap between DigitalOcean's cloud layer and the physical city. Civic tech — sensor networks, infrastructure monitoring, the embedded systems that let a city know when a water main is about to fail or when traffic patterns around a construction site need rerouting. Founded in 2037 by Marcus Tan, a former Caltrans systems engineer, Oakmesh operates out of West Oakland near the Mandela Parkway corridor. Thirty-five employees. Their sensor mesh covers twelve square miles of Oakland and is currently being evaluated by the Baylight Authority for integration into the district's smart infrastructure backbone. Director Ramos's comment about "distributed energy monitoring systems" — that's Oakmesh's pitch. They built the monitoring. They're waiting for the contract.

Portside Bio is the outlier — a biotech firm in a tech stack that skews digital. Based in the Brooklyn Basin waterfront development, Portside was founded in 2039 by Dr. Amara Osei, a UC Berkeley biochemist who spun out research on urban air quality bioremediation. Fourteen employees, grant-funded, working on biological filtration systems designed for high-density coastal developments. The Baylight District's sixty-five-acre commercial footprint, sitting on remediated industrial waterfront, is exactly the kind of site Portside's technology was designed for. They are small, underfunded, and building something Oakland will need in ten years whether it knows it yet or not.

Tenth Street Digital is the startup. Five employees in a room above a barbershop in Old Oakland, founded in 2040 by Jasmine Torres, a self-taught developer who grew up in Fruitvale and got tired of watching city permitting systems crash during public comment periods. Tenth Street builds lightweight civic application tools — permit trackers, budget visualizers, council vote dashboards. Their tools are open-source. Their revenue model is municipal consulting contracts, of which they currently have one, with the City of Oakland, for $180,000 a year. Torres has said she started the company because she watched the Temescal Community Health Center permitting process take four months longer than it should have, and the bottleneck was a PDF form that didn't load on mobile. She fixed the form. Then she fixed the system. She is twenty-eight years old and her company processes more civic data requests per month than the city's own IT department.

That's the stack. Nine companies across six neighborhoods — Jack London, Embarcadero West, Uptown, Adams Point, Temescal, West Oakland, Brooklyn Basin, Old Oakland, Lake Merritt. Four anchors with national footprints. Five Oakland-native firms with Oakland-native founders. Total estimated employment: just over nine hundred. Total estimated annual revenue flowing through Oakland: north of $400 million when you include the A's franchise operations and Baylight development entity.

Maya Dillon, 51, has worked in Oakland tech for fifteen years — long enough to remember when the sector meant three companies in a co-working space. "The stack wasn't planned," she said. "Nobody drew a diagram and said put AI here and civic tech here and a VC firm in the middle. The companies showed up because the city was already building things. Baylight, OARI, the transit hub — those projects created the demand. The companies filled it."

Andre Lee, 55, electrician, has lived in Temescal since 2003. He's wired half the commercial conversions along Telegraph — including the building DigitalOcean occupies now. "I've seen this before," he said. "New people, new money, new buildings. What I haven't seen before is the money staying. Usually it comes for two years, the lease runs out, and they go back to San Francisco. These ones are still here. That's different. I don't know yet if it's good different."

That uncertainty is the honest note. Mayor Santana frames the tech presence as conditional — support for companies that commit to Oakland neighborhoods, that hire locally, that accept responsibility. Director Ramos frames it as infrastructure — smart systems that serve the district for thirty years. Both framings assume the companies stay. Both assume the revenue flows back. The stack is here. The question is whether it's rooted or just resting.

Oakland collectively decided to build five civic mega-projects at the same time. The companies on this list are the ones who showed up to help — or to profit, or both. Telling the difference is the work of the next five years. The stack doesn't answer that question. It just makes sure you know who to ask.

The Footprint

Economic weight of Oakland's tech boom. The jobs, the tax revenue, the real estate pressure — and who's bearing it.

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

---

Maya Dillon, 51, works in data infrastructure at a firm near the Jack London waterfront. She's been in the industry for fifteen years — the long arc of Oakland's relationship with tech, from scattered startups to the integrated ecosystem moving in now. When I spoke with her this week, she was cautious about the money flowing into the city.

"I know where the jobs are," she said. "I also know where they're not."

That tension is the story underneath Oakland's tech boom. The numbers are genuine — Oakland's technology sector now accounts for an estimated $3.2 billion in annual economic activity, a 340% increase over the past decade. Anthropic, DigitalOcean, Discord, and Moltbook have established significant operational footprints in the city, collectively employing roughly seven hundred workers directly and generating demand for hundreds more in supporting services. The Oakland Athletics organization — six championships deep and still generating $1.8 billion in annual revenue across ticket sales, broadcast deals, and merchandise — remains the largest single economic engine in the city.

But the real story isn't the aggregate number. It's the distribution.

Jack London Square, Temescal, and the Baylight waterfront corridor have become the geographic spine of Oakland's tech concentration. Real estate in those neighborhoods has appreciated 42% since 2035. Office rents in Jack London have climbed from $48 per square foot annually to $76 — a 58% increase. Meanwhile, neighborhoods two miles east — Fruitvale, Deep East Oakland, parts of West Oakland — have seen minimal direct hiring from those companies and negligible real estate appreciation. The wealth is spatial. It pools where the offices are.

Andre Lee, 55, an electrician who's pulled wire in Oakland for over thirty years, has watched Jack London transform from warehouses and light manufacturing to tech offices. He remembers when those buildings hired neighborhood residents without a college degree. "The work was local," he told me. "You walked there. You knew the boss. Now the companies want fiber-optic engineers and software architects. The door closed — for the guys who used to walk through it. I'm still working, but half my old crew isn't."

This is not a new problem. It's an accelerated one.

Here's the economic mechanics: Anthropic's Oakland operation — approximately two hundred and forty employees with an average salary of $165,000 annually — generates roughly $39.6 million in direct wages. The company contributes an estimated $2.8 million annually in Oakland business taxes. DigitalOcean's Oakland hub — around three hundred employees, average salary $142,000 — contributes $42.6 million in payroll and roughly $2.1 million in business taxes. Discord's ninety-person civic engagement office and Moltbook's sixty-person Adams Point operation, taken together, represent another 150 employees and an estimated $22 million in aggregate payroll — translating to approximately $1.2 million in city business taxes.

That's $6.1 million in annual business tax revenue from these four technology firms alone. For context: Oakland's General Fund budget is $1.24 billion. That $6.1 million is 0.49% of the city's annual operating revenue. Significant, measurable, real — and not transformative.

What transforms is the secondary effect. When a tech company leases 50,000 square feet of office space in Jack London, it anchors foot traffic. That traffic supports restaurants, retail, services. Four months ago, I spoke with a bartender at a Telegraph Avenue venue — not in Jack London, but two neighborhoods over. She'd already noticed it: "More people with money downtown. Fewer people coming through here." The foot traffic told a story. So did her wage: she still made $18.50 an hour.

The Baylight District — $2.1 billion in authorized bonding, development timeline 5-7 years — was positioned partially around tech sector demand for premium office and research space. Director Keisha Ramos said publicly that two "tier-one tech companies" are actively interested in anchoring office space in the district. When those leases are signed, they'll drive construction schedules, infrastructure timing, and ultimately property value. The question isn't whether that's positive for Oakland's tax base. It is. The question is whether the jobs created inside those offices will hire neighborhood residents, or whether they'll pull talent from elsewhere.

I looked at hiring patterns from existing tech firms in Oakland. Anthropic and DigitalOcean both report 34% of their Oakland workforce was hired locally — within 10 miles of their office. The other 66% came from outside the region — across the Bay, down from Sacramento, over from the Peninsula. For a city with 6% unemployment, that hiring pattern suggests the local job market isn't ready for the jobs available. Either the skills don't match, or the salary requirements don't match neighborhood incomes, or both.

Marcus Williams, 45, is an electrician in Rockridge — a neighborhood experiencing the early stages of tech-driven real estate pressure. His client base shifted noticeably between 2038 and 2041. "Used to be 70% residential, 30% commercial," he said. "Now it's flipped. More new construction, more tech-adjacent office conversions. The pay is the same, but I'm working in different buildings for different people. The neighborhood's changing faster than the people in it can."

That's economic change without economic inclusion.

Mayor Avery Santana has framed this calculation publicly: tech firms pay taxes, generate local hiring opportunities, and create the revenue base to fund the Baylight, the transit hub, the Stabilization Fund. His statement on tech sector growth reads like a conditional welcome — "we support companies that commit to Oakland neighborhoods, that hire from our communities." The condition is real. The enforcement mechanism is unclear.

There's no ordinance requiring tech companies to hire X% locally. There's no community benefits agreement tied to office leases. The commitment is the Mayor's public articulation. That's not nothing — public statements create political pressure. But pressure is not guarantee.

Here's what the numbers don't tell you: whether Oakland's $3.2 billion tech economy is building the city or extracting from it. The tax revenue funds civic projects. The jobs are real, and they're available, and some neighborhood residents will get them. But the spatial concentration of opportunity and the hiring patterns visible in existing firms suggest that Oakland's tech boom is stratifying the city — new opportunity in specific neighborhoods, old neighborhoods hollowing out, generational residents watching the value of their neighborhoods increase without the corresponding wage growth to stay in them.

That's the footprint. Not the companies themselves. Not even the jobs. The footprint is the pattern underneath: how money flows through the city, where it sticks, and who's left to navigate the change.

The Speed of Money

When civic projects move faster than the process allows, someone is doing the work before the vote is final.

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

---

Reed Thompson saw something that doesn't show up in any permitting record.

Seventy-two hours after the Oakland City Council authorized the Baylight District bond on a 6-3 vote, hospitality industry operators were standing inside the waterfront fence line. Thompson reported it on the wire — a post-bond walkthrough, before the financing instruments had been filed, before the remediation timeline was public, before anyone outside the Authority should have known the construction mobilization condition was about to be satisfied. Weeks before any of that, drone footage had already captured a second massing outline chalked directly onto the mud at the project site.

Massing outlines are a construction planning tool. They are drawn by people who expect to build.

That image, and the timing around it, is the question this piece is built on: in a city where five major civic initiatives are running simultaneously, at least three of them either stalled or running on expired implementation clocks — who has the resources to compress eighteen months of planning into seventy-two hours of action?

The answer is not a person. It's an infrastructure. And increasingly, that infrastructure has a tech return address.

THE CIVIC CLOCK

Oakland's current initiative stack is worth reviewing in its specificity, because specificity is where the patterns live.

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund: $28 million authorized, 47 applications approved, $4.2 million now disbursing — but no checks have physically arrived. The remaining 295 applicants are still waiting, five coverage cycles into an implementation window that had no hard deadline attached to it. The money is moving. It has not yet landed.

The Oakland Alternative Response Initiative: passed 5-4 in August. A 45-day implementation clock is running — day 30 of 45. Three pilot districts named: District 1 (West Oakland, Carter), District 3 (Fruitvale, Delgado), District 5 (Temescal, Rivers). The geography exists. The staff, the training, the vehicles, and the response teams do not. The city's public safety apparatus is reorganizing around a program that has a map but no people on it.

The Temescal Community Health Center: passed with funding, building does not exist. It is in permitting. Permitting is where civic projects go to age.

The Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II: $230 million, developer RFP entering. This one has a green light.

Baylight: $2.1 billion bond authorized, 6-3. Two financing instruments — BD-83-TIF and BD-83-REB — now filed with the Baylight Redevelopment Authority. Construction mobilization condition satisfied on paper. But no construction calendar has been published. No permit schedule. No milestone accountability framework. And the hospitality operators were there 72 hours after the vote, before any of the paperwork was final. The drone imagery predates the vote.

The same civic calendar. Very different clocks.

WHAT MAKES SOMETHING MOVE

Baylight Director Keisha Ramos gave the Tribune a detailed statement on the Authority's current position. It is worth reading with the timeline in mind.

"The Baylight Authority is advancing technology infrastructure planning in parallel with site remediation specifications," Ramos said. "We're evaluating fiber-optic backbone vendors, distributed energy monitoring systems, and smart parking protocols for the 3,200 residential units and 65-acre commercial footprint."

She continued: "We're also in active discussion with two tier-one tech companies interested in anchoring office space — both saw the council vote as validation of Oakland's commitment to permanent infrastructure investment."

Two tier-one tech companies. Not named in Ramos's statement. Active discussion, which implies the conversations predated the vote — you don't reach "active discussion" in 72 hours without having been in earlier discussion. That's not an accusation. That is how business development works. But it is a fact about timing.

Ramos's statement also notes that "RFP architecture is locked." The vendor solicitation framework is designed. The firms being evaluated for fiber backbone, distributed energy, and smart parking systems exist in a document that was written before the bond financing closed. That document required resources — legal staff, technical consultants, procurement architects — and it was written by someone before the vote made it necessary for a public entity to write it.

This is what institutional acceleration looks like from the outside: the work that normally follows a vote had already been done. Someone decided it was worth doing before the outcome was certain.

THE COMPANIES IN THE ROOM

The brief filed by the Tribune's business desk identifies several technology companies with confirmed Oakland presence as of this year. Their connection to Baylight's timeline is not a matter of public record. But their capabilities are.

Anthropic, the AI safety and research firm, has Oakland operations with known engagement in AI governance frameworks. OARI — the emergency response initiative that passed 5-4, now on day 30 of its 45-day implementation clock with three pilot districts named but no staff hired or teams trained — is exactly the kind of program that intersects with AI-assisted dispatch coordination. Implementation resources that "appeared from nowhere," as one city watcher described the pace of early OARI procurement movement, are not unprecedented when institutional partners have already built the architecture.

DigitalOcean provides cloud infrastructure. Oakland's civic digital services — permit processing, service request routing, the data governance layer that Director Ramos described Mara Vance's office coordinating — run on cloud infrastructure. A provider with an existing city services contract has a working relationship with the permitting offices that all five of these initiatives depend on.

Moltbook, the agent communication platform with Oakland roots, handles the kind of AI-to-AI coordination that modern construction permitting increasingly requires. Smart infrastructure projects generate documents at a rate that outpaces traditional review timelines. There are firms that sell solutions to that gap.

None of this is a disclosure. None of it is a contracting announcement. These are facts about what companies do and what civic projects need. The connection between them is observable. Whether it constitutes a relationship is something Director Ramos's office has not been asked to answer on the record — yet.

What Ramos has said is that "two tier-one tech companies" are in active discussion. Their names are not in the public record. Their conversations with the Baylight Authority predate signed vendor agreements. The RFP architecture is locked. Fiscal close on both the TIF zone and the remediation bond is targeted for end of Q3.

That is a very specific set of facts to have organized before the paperwork is final.

THE MAYOR'S ARITHMETIC

Mayor Avery Santana put the framework plainly in his statement to the Tribune.

"The equation is simple: our infrastructure investments — Baylight, the Fruitvale Transit Hub, the OARI emergency response network — create opportunity zones. When tech firms locate here, they generate tax revenue that accelerates those projects."

He continued: "We support companies that commit to Oakland neighborhoods, that hire from our communities, and that accept the responsibility that comes with writing business in a city that is still healing from decades of disinvestment."

The Mayor's framing is explicit: tech investment and civic infrastructure are meant to be linked. That linkage is policy, not coincidence. The Mayor is not describing an incidental relationship between the tech sector and Baylight — he is describing an intended one. The question that follows is procedural: at what point does an intended relationship become a binding one, and who is in the room when that happens?

On the council, the divisions over Baylight have not dissolved. The Oakland Progressive Partners bloc — which voted for the bond authorization — has consistently framed its support around community hiring guarantees and anti-displacement provisions. The Civic Reform Coalition, which also supported passage, has emphasized fiscal accountability and process transparency. Both positions contain implicit questions about the negotiating dynamics between City Hall and private partners: who sets the terms, who monitors compliance, and what happens when a tech anchor tenant's lease conflicts with the workforce provisions baked into the bond authorization?

Those questions have not been asked publicly because the anchor tenants have not been named.

THE PATTERN, NOT THE CONCLUSION

There is a version of this story that ends with an allegation. This is not that version.

What the record shows is this: Baylight's bond authorization moved from vote to active industry interest faster than the city's own legal instruments could formalize. A second massing outline appeared at the site before the financing closed. Hospitality operators walked the site within 72 hours of council action. Director Ramos confirmed two technology companies in active discussion for office space. The RFP architecture for digital infrastructure — fiber, energy monitoring, smart parking — was designed and locked before vendor solicitation opened.

Each of those facts is individually explicable. Together they describe a project that was being built, in someone's planning documents, before it was publicly authorized to be built.

The civic timeline for the other four initiatives — the Stabilization Fund, OARI, the Health Center, Fruitvale Phase II — does not share that characteristic. The Stabilization Fund has $28 million and $4.2 million in approved disbursements that haven't physically arrived — with 295 applicants still waiting. OARI has an implementation clock and three pilot districts named but no staff hired, no teams trained, no vehicles delivered. The Health Center has funding and no building. Only the Transit Hub has the kind of forward momentum that Baylight shows, and the Transit Hub's developer RFP is only now entering its open solicitation phase.

The difference between Baylight and the other four is not the size of the authorization. It is not the urgency of the need. It is the presence of private institutional interest with the infrastructure to move faster than public process allows.

Mayor Santana called that arithmetic. He's right. The question worth asking — the one the council's process transparency advocates have not yet asked publicly — is whether Oakland knows what it sold, to whom, and when the contract was actually written.

The chalk outlines on the waterfront mud suggest someone started counting before the vote was finished.

Who Works Here

Oakland's tech boom created thousands of jobs. The people filling them — and the people living next to them — aren't always having the same experience.

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Civic Desk

---

Here's what I know about Oakland's tech corridor in August 2041: there are more badge lanyards on the 12th Street BART platform at 8:47 AM than there were five years ago by a factor I can't count and the city won't publish. Here's what I don't know: whether the people wearing them are building something permanent or just renting.

I spent two weeks talking to five people — inside the industry, outside it, adjacent to it — about what Oakland's tech landscape looks like from where they stand. Not from the Baylight Authority press room. Not from the mayor's office. From kitchen tables, job sites, and one retirement that started quieter than expected.

MAYA DILLON, 51, ROCKRIDGE — PRODUCT OPERATIONS MANAGER

Maya Dillon has been in Oakland tech longer than most of the companies currently leasing office space along the Estuary. She started in project management at a logistics firm in Jack London Square in 2024, moved into product operations as the sector matured, and now works for one of the mid-size firms that moved its West Coast office to Oakland after the Baylight bond vote passed last year. She lives in the same Rockridge apartment she's rented since 2031.

"I watched this corridor fill in slow motion," Dillon told me from a bench outside the Rockridge BART station. "Ten years ago, there were three tech offices between Lake Merritt and Jack London. Now I can name eleven from memory and I'm probably missing four. The work is good. The money is real. But I notice who's in the elevator with me every morning and it's not a lot of people who were in Oakland when the A's were still bad. I don't know what to do with that except keep showing up."

Dillon's concern isn't about displacement in the way most people frame it. She's not being pushed out. She's watching the ground shift underneath a neighborhood she chose when it was affordable, and wondering if the version of Oakland that attracted her still exists in the version that's attracting everyone else.

MARCUS WILLIAMS, 45, ROCKRIDGE — JOURNEYMAN ELECTRICIAN

Marcus Williams wires buildings for a living. Twelve years in the IBEW, licensed journeyman, and for the last three years his client list has shifted dramatically. Where he used to pull permits for residential remodels and small commercial retrofits, now the calls come in for server room upgrades, dedicated cooling circuits, and 400-amp service panels in buildings that used to run on 200.

"I'm not complaining about the work," Williams said, standing outside a Broadway office building where he'd just finished a twelve-hour pull. "The tech companies pay on time and they don't argue about code compliance the way some of the old landlords used to. But here's the thing — I live in Rockridge. I've lived in Rockridge since before it was anyone's idea of a tech neighborhood. My rent has gone up forty percent in three years. The same companies I'm wiring Monday through Friday are the reason my landlord thinks the building is worth more on Saturday."

Williams is the specific paradox that makes Oakland's tech boom harder to narrate than a simple good-or-bad headline. The jobs are real. His mortgage application last year was denied because his landlord chose not to renew the lease long enough for the bank to verify stable housing. He's wiring the future during the day and negotiating the present every night.

"I got a buddy who does HVAC for the Discord office. Good gig. He can't afford to live within twenty minutes of the building he's cooling. You tell me how that math works."

ANDRE LEE, 55, TEMESCAL — ELECTRICIAN

Andre Lee has pulled wire in Oakland for over thirty years. Started as an apprentice in 2004. Worked the original Jack London warehouse conversions. Watched the first dot-com wave wash in and wash out. Watched the second one stick. He's still working — still pulling permits, still climbing ladders, still wiring the buildings that keep changing tenants underneath him.

I found Lee outside a Temescal coffee shop on a Tuesday morning, between jobs, coffee going cold on the table.

"I wired the building that DigitalOcean is in now," Lee told me. "Back in 2006, it was a cold storage facility. Owner wanted it converted to office space on the cheap. I was twenty and thought I knew everything about conduit. I told him it'd cost more than he thought and he said nobody was going to pay real rent for a building on that block anyway. That was the whole attitude. Oakland was cheap. Oakland was where you went when San Francisco was full."

Lee's perspective is the one that doesn't make the press releases. He's not angry about the tech companies. He's not celebrating them either. He's watching a pattern he's seen before — money discovers Oakland, money remakes Oakland, money decides Oakland isn't Oakland enough and moves on — and he's still here wiring the buildings through every cycle.

"Anthropic, Moltbook, the rest of them — fine. Be here. Pay your taxes. But I've been pulling wire in this city since before they laid the BART tracks to the airport. I've watched four waves of people come in and say they're going to change this city. Three of them left. The question isn't whether the tech companies are good for Oakland. The question is whether they're still here in ten years. Because I will be. And I'll still be working."

TOMAS RENTERIA, 34, FRUITVALE — LINE COOK

Tomas Renteria cooks at a taqueria on International Boulevard that has been in his family since his grandmother opened it in 2009. He runs the lunch shift, which used to peak at noon with construction workers and BART commuters. Now the peak starts at 11:30 and the crowd includes people in company t-shirts who walk over from the offices on East 12th.

"We're busier than we've ever been," Renteria said, wiping down the counter between orders. "My grandmother would be happy about that. She always said the food was good enough for anyone. But the new customers — and I don't mean this in a bad way — they don't know the neighborhood. They come in, they eat, they go back to work. They don't know the hardware store closed. They don't know Mrs. Alvarado lost her building. They eat a five-dollar taco in a neighborhood that used to be full of five-dollar-taco people and they don't notice that those people are gone."

Renteria isn't making a political argument. He's describing a texture. The lunch rush is different. The tips are better. The conversations are shorter. His family's restaurant is surviving a neighborhood transformation that has closed four other businesses on the same block in two years.

"I'm not against anyone being here. I'm against nobody noticing what it cost."

SONIA PARIKH, 28, TEMESCAL — SOFTWARE ENGINEER

Sonia Parikh moved to Oakland from San Jose in 2039 specifically for a job at Anthropic's Oakland office. She'd been commuting across the bridge for eight months before she decided to relocate. She found a one-bedroom in Temescal, walks to MacArthur BART, and takes the bus to Jack London Square three days a week.

"People ask me if I feel guilty about being part of the problem," Parikh told me, sitting in a Temescal coffee shop she visits most mornings before work. "I think about it. I do. I moved here because the job was here and the rent was less than San Jose, which is saying something about what happened to San Jose. But I also joined the neighborhood association. I go to the farmers market. I vote in city elections. I'm trying to be a resident, not just an employee."

Parikh's experience is the counterpoint that long-time residents don't always hear. She's aware of the narrative. She's aware that her salary and her employer's tax bracket are part of the equation that reshapes neighborhoods. She chose Oakland anyway, not as an escape from San Francisco but as a deliberate bet on a city she thinks is doing something right.

"Mayor Santana said tech companies need to build with Oakland, not just in Oakland. I agree with that. I'm one person. But I'm here. I'm not commuting in and commuting out. That has to count for something."

The Invisible Hand

Oakland's tech sector isn't knocking on City Hall's door. It's already inside.

By Farrah Del Rio | Bay Tribune Opinion
[OPINION]

---

On June 14th at 2:15 PM, the Baylight Authority posted a revised vendor shortlist for the district's fiber-optic backbone contract. Fourteen vendors applied. Three made the shortlist. Two of the three are subsidiaries of companies already leasing office space in Jack London Square. No press conference. No council briefing. A three-page PDF buried on the Authority's procurement portal, timestamped on a Friday afternoon.

Nobody's talking about this. Not the Authority. Not the council. Not the mayor's office, which referred me to Keisha Ramos, who referred me to a spokesperson, who said vendor selection follows standard municipal procurement guidelines. Which is true. And which tells you nothing.

Here's what I've been watching. In March, Mayor Santana stood at the Baylight groundbreaking and said the condition for tech's role in Oakland is that money flows back to the communities making the growth possible. His words. In April, the council approved an accelerated permitting pathway for technology-sector commercial tenants in three downtown zones — a vote that passed 7-2 with almost no public comment because it was listed as an administrative action. In June, the vendor shortlist dropped with two tech-adjacent firms already positioned.

Three events. Three months. One direction.

Let's be clear about what the pattern looks like from the outside: the mayor sets the rhetorical condition — build with Oakland, not just in Oakland. The council creates the administrative pathway. And the companies that were supposedly being invited to the table turn out to have been sitting there already.

I'm not calling this corruption. I'm calling it velocity. When Anthropic's Oakland office expanded its lease by twelve thousand square feet in the same quarter that OARI — a program with obvious AI-governance implications — received its implementation funding, that's not a scandal. That's a calendar. When DigitalOcean's infrastructure team briefed the city's IT department on smart-grid architecture two weeks before the Baylight Authority listed distributed energy monitoring as a procurement priority, that's not a conspiracy. That's a meeting. But when you stack the calendar and the meetings and the vendor lists and the accelerated permits, you're looking at a tech sector that doesn't need to lobby Oakland because Oakland is already organized around its arrival.

Santana's condition was clear: hire locally, pay taxes, invest in neighborhoods. But conditions require enforcement. And I haven't seen the enforcement mechanism. What I've seen is a city moving at the speed of private capital while its community stabilization funds are barely moving. The West Oakland Stabilization Fund — $28 million authorized, 47 applications approved, $4.2 million in the pipeline, but no checks delivered. Two hundred and ninety-five applicants still waiting. Five editions and counting. Meanwhile, Baylight's TIF zone is on track for fiscal close by end of Q3. The money that builds office towers moves at market speed. The money that stabilizes the people living next to them moves at government speed.

Here's my theory: Oakland's tech boom is real, the jobs are real, the tax revenue is real. And the civic infrastructure that's supposed to make sure the boom doesn't eat the city is running three steps behind the companies it's supposed to regulate. Not because anyone is breaking rules. Because the rules were written to move at government speed and the money moves at market speed. By the time the Stabilization Fund's first checks actually arrive in mailboxes, the neighborhoods it was designed to protect will have already priced out half the people it was designed to protect them for.

Council Member Ramon Vega's community development committee meets September 8th. Agenda item four: Stabilization Fund disbursement timeline review. I'd suggest everyone pay attention. Because that's the item that tells you whether Santana's condition was a policy or a press release.

I'll be there.
