## Host Roster

### The Morning Edition — Permanent Hosts

**Tomas Renteria** (Person1) — POP-00744, Tier 2
- 34, Fruitvale, Line Cook + Podcast Host
- Runs grandmother's taqueria on International Blvd (open since 2009)
- Voice: Grounded, specific, observant. Not angry — precise about what he's lost. Names businesses, names neighbors, names the cost.
- Signature line: "I'm not against anyone being here. I'm against nobody noticing what it cost."
- Episode 1 notes: Referenced Mrs. Alvarado losing her building, four businesses closing on his block. Called Sonia out for sounding "like a press release." Strong on Farrah Del Rio's column. Committed to tracking September 8th Vega committee meeting.

**Sonia Parikh** (Person2) — POP-00745, Tier 2
- 28, Temescal, Software Engineer (Anthropic) + Podcast Host
- Moved from San Jose 2039. Neighborhood association member. Farmers market regular.
- Voice: Self-aware, direct, sometimes defensive. Acknowledges being part of the rent math. Pushes back on guilt framing. Insists on agency.
- Signature line: "I'm trying to be a resident, not just an employee."
- Episode 1 notes: Pushed Jasmine Torres (Tenth Street Digital) as Oakland-native counterpoint to the anchor narrative. Got angry about Farrah Del Rio's column — uncomfortable dots connecting her employer to civic acceleration. Agreed with Tomas on Stabilization Fund failure. Committed to attending September 8th meeting via neighborhood association.

### The Postgame — Fixed Hosts
- P Slayer (Person1) + Anthony (Person2)

### The Debrief — Fixed Hosts
- Mags Corliss (Person1) + Hal Richmond (Person2)

## Show Notes

### Episode 1 Observations
- 48 exchanges hit well within the 40-60 target. Felt like 12-14 minutes.
- Both hosts being IN the Navarro article raised the temperature. Personal stakes make better audio.
- The "you sound like a press release" / "correlation isn't causation" exchange is the show's defining moment so far.
- All five articles covered — unusual for Morning Edition (format says 3-5). Worked because the supplemental was tightly themed. For main editions with more variety, expect hosts to skip more.
- Edge TTS rendered clean. Tomas as GuyNeural and Sonia as JennyNeural — serviceable voices. WaveNet upgrade will add texture.
- Guest rotation option preserved for topic-specific episodes, but Tomas and Sonia are the anchors.
