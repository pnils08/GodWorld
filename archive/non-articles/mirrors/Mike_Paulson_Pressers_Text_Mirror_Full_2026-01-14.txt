PAULSON RETURNS TO OAKLAND: “THIS IS HOME”

GM faces city for first time since walkout, reveals Osei hospitalized after traffic collision

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

OAKLAND — Mike Paulson stood at an Oakland podium for the first time since walking out of one three cycles ago. He didn’t hide from it.

“I’d like to address this off the bat and just express my regret on how I reacted to the situation,” Paulson said. “I acted poorly in the moment and Oakland citizens certainly deserve more than that.”

The GM, fresh off an NBA Cup championship in Chicago and a preliminary stadium agreement for the Baylight District, faced the Oakland media room Tuesday with something that had been missing since the health crisis debacle: directness.

“I shouldn’t have made predictions on the health crisis and been overly enthusiastic about an end to it,” Paulson continued. “The line of questioning turned to how I knew this when I should’ve just kept my support to the medical community and not minimized the situation with a prediction.”

But the apology wasn’t the only news.

Paulson revealed that Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei — the city’s lead stadium negotiator who has been absent since Cycle 72 — was hospitalized following a traffic collision. It was the first public confirmation of what happened to the civic official whose silence had fueled weeks of speculation.

“Marcus is a very close friend and news has been scarce on his situation, but I’ve been in contact and he wanted me to share an update,” Paulson said. “He’s on the mend and doing some recovery. That’s about all I can share right now.”

Osei, Paulson added, is already trying to work from his hospital bed. “He’s a tough one.”

The presser covered baseball, the stadium, the health crisis, and the fundamental question that has followed Paulson across two cities: Where does he actually belong?

His answer was unambiguous.

“Oakland is home. This is where I plan to raise my family and retire someday.”

PAULSON ON SEYMOUR: “I’M A HUGE FAN”

GM pushes back on absence narrative, reveals three-day weekly Mesa schedule

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Mike Paulson wants to correct the record on Deacon Seymour — and on his own whereabouts.

“I’m a huge fan of Deacon,” Paulson said Tuesday. “I understand the concerns but I’m confident in his abilities. I couple that with having a young nucleus that’s ready to win.”

Then came the pushback.

“It’s untrue to suggest I have not been to Mesa. I am able to manage my time effectively to be in Mesa three days a week and Chicago three days a week. Of course my office is with me seven days.”

The travel schedule — three days Oakland/Mesa, three days Chicago, office always on — hasn’t been publicly reported before. It suggests a more hands-on approach than critics assumed during Paulson’s extended Chicago visibility around the Bulls’ championship run.

“Time will tell on that story and I understand the concerns,” Paulson acknowledged. “We are taking all precautions to ensure success.”

On the roster, Paulson pointed to pitching depth as the key difference between this year and the ALCS loss to Boston.

“We played too many games these past playoffs where the offense was carrying the load. A lot of 8 to 9 run games. If we limit some of those, the 7 we score looks a lot better.”

The offseason moves — adding Travis Coles as a second ace, bringing Benji Dillon back for the five spot, acquiring a young closer and a top-20 pitching prospect — were designed to address exactly that weakness.

“The truth of the matter is we have more depth in the farm than the roster. This offseason we escalated a few positions is all. The bullpen is uber talented so we just have to get the mix set even if that means making moves in season.”

Spring training opens against San Diego. Seymour’s first professional game is days away. Paulson says he’ll be there.

PAULSON BACKS HORN: “BEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE”

GM endorses center fielder’s bold claim

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Danny Horn said he’s the best player in baseball. His GM agrees.

“Horn is a perfectionist so it’s on par to make those claims — if he doesn’t believe it then it can’t be true,” Paulson said Tuesday. “I do agree with Horn being the most talented athlete and all-around best player in the league.”

Horn’s 2040 numbers support the argument: .280 average, 32 home runs, 98 RBIs, 35 stolen bases, .524 slugging, .879 OPS, 8.0 WAR. The 30-30 club is exclusive. The 32-35 club barely exists.

Asked how the organization manages that kind of confidence in a clubhouse with veterans like Vinnie Keane and Benji Dillon, Paulson was direct.

“We try to manage winning, and winning backs down to no one.”

KEANE’S FINAL SEASON — AND A DYNASTY CELEBRATION

Paulson announces plans to honor championship era throughout 2041

By Mags Corliss | Bay Tribune Sports

Vinnie Keane’s farewell tour just got bigger.

Mike Paulson announced Tuesday that the A’s will dedicate the 2041 season to honoring Keane’s final year — and the dynasty he helped build. But the celebration won’t stop at the third baseman.

“We will also be doing some stuff for Benji,” Paulson said, referring to pitcher Benji Dillon, who returned this offseason on a one-year, $13 million deal. “We will be bringing older players from those runs and honoring it all. The vision that’s clear to all — we are showing the youth what the expectation is.”

When asked if the season constitutes a farewell tour for Dillon as well, Paulson stopped short of confirming.

“I wouldn’t call it a farewell, but we will be honoring the dynasty with Keane’s retirement, so naturally Benji will be a part of that.”

On Keane’s future beyond playing, Paulson left the door wide open.

“Vinnie is a man of many fames as we all know, so he most definitely will have all his options available to him. I’m sure he could play a few more years if he wanted to. We’d love to have Vinnie here but may be too hard to keep him from the national media camera.”

The dynasty celebration — featuring returns from championship-era players — will mark the first time the organization has formally honored the six-title run while core members are still active.

OSEI HOSPITALIZED AFTER TRAFFIC COLLISION — PAULSON CONFIRMS

Deputy Mayor “on the mend” after weeks of public silence

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

The silence on Marcus Osei is broken.

Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei, the city’s lead economic development official and primary stadium negotiator, has been hospitalized since Cycle 72 following a traffic collision, GM Mike Paulson confirmed Tuesday.

“Marcus is a very close friend and news has been scarce on his situation, but I’ve been in contact and he wanted me to share an update,” Paulson said during his Oakland press availability. “Marcus was in a traffic collision and has been hospitalized for a few cycles now. He’s on the mend and doing some recovery.”

Paulson described Osei as “a tough one” who is already attempting to work from his hospital bed despite his condition.

The confirmation ends weeks of speculation about the deputy mayor’s absence. City officials had listed Osei as being in “serious condition” without elaboration, leading to questions about whether his absence would affect the Baylight District stadium negotiations.

Paulson credited multiple figures for keeping the deal on track during Osei’s absence.

“The Mayor has been a huge advocate for the project, and a lesser-known hero on this is Mark Aitken,” Paulson said, referring to the A’s third baseman who was recently named an MLBPA association representative. “I will tell you Mark is a future politician.”

The Baylight agreement now advances to the City Planning Committee. Paulson expressed confidence despite the civic office operating at reduced capacity.

“This has been in the works for some time so the structure has been mostly in place. That said, we would most definitely benefit from being at full strength, but like our teams, sometimes you have to make do with who’s available.”

No update was provided on Elliott Crane, the Business Caucus Leader who has also been listed as injured since Cycle 72. Paulson said only that “we expect to have him back at work soon.”

BAYLIGHT DISTRICT: “THE FANS WANTING IT IS THE BIGGEST REASON”

Paulson outlines stadium philosophy, ties success to city prosperity

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

The A’s aren’t asking for Oakland’s money. They’re asking for Oakland’s belief.

Mike Paulson outlined the Baylight District philosophy Tuesday, emphasizing that the franchise is seeking tax exemptions rather than public funding — and tying the stadium’s success directly to the city’s economic health.

“We always saw Oakland as home,” Paulson said. “When the Las Vegas deal fell through, we were pleased to be able to play in the Arizona Diamondbacks stadium, but now we are ready to take Oakland back.”

The preliminary agreement, announced alongside Mayor Avery Santana earlier this cycle, requires no direct public investment. Instead, the A’s are seeking variable tax exemptions that would scale with city performance.

“We feel the tax plan is fair and we are not looking for a set rate,” Paulson explained. “We believe this plan is more in line with the city’s success than the franchise’s.”

The framing is notable: rather than asking Oakland to subsidize a stadium, the A’s are positioning their tax relief as aligned with broader civic prosperity. If Oakland thrives, the exemptions matter less. If Oakland struggles, the franchise shares the burden.

When asked about a backup plan if the City Planning Committee rejects the proposal, Paulson declined to entertain the scenario — suggesting the organization views this as the only viable path.

On the question of jobs and timeline, Paulson pushed back against the notion that benefits are years away.

“A stadium may be a couple years away but the jobs are not. As soon as we are able, shovels are hitting dirt. Stimulation starts.”

PAULSON ON TEMESCAL: “WE STAND READY AS A PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY”

A’s announce hospital visits, awareness campaign — no predictions this time

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Bay Tribune Health Desk

Mike Paulson addressed the Temescal health crisis for the first time since his walkout — and this time, he stayed in his lane.

“As a resident of Oakland, I too am concerned and focused on what I can do to help start getting some resolve and understanding,” Paulson said Tuesday. “I think the part that has people worried is the unknown nature of the crisis.”

No predictions. No timelines. No speculation about when it might end.

Instead, Paulson praised the medical community’s response: “They have done a brilliant job keeping the cases from escalating in severity.”

And he announced concrete organizational action.

“We will have players visiting local hospitals and clinics. We also will be running informative media spots featuring players to raise awareness. We stand by ready and willing to do our part as a pillar of the community.”

The health crisis in Temescal is entering its fifth week. Community mutual aid networks have formed in the absence of official answers about causes or timeline. The arc strength remains elevated. Clinics continue monitoring.

Paulson’s response Tuesday — supportive without overstepping, concrete without predicting — stood in stark contrast to the presser that caused his walkout. He’s learned something.

Whether it’s enough for Temescal remains to be seen.

HE CAME BACK

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

He apologized to me.

Not to the room. To me. By name. For walking out on my question.

“P, I’m surprised you’re letting me off the hook on the health crisis fiasco. I know I walked out on your questioning and honestly I’m most ashamed of that. You are the heart of the city’s passion and I didn’t honor that. I sincerely apologize.”

I’ve been doing this job a long time. I’ve asked hard questions of owners, GMs, managers, players. I’ve been ignored. I’ve been dismissed. I’ve been cursed at once or twice. I’ve never had someone come back to a podium and apologize directly for how they treated me in a previous presser.

I don’t know what to do with that.

So I asked him what I really wanted to know: What are you chasing? You have everything. Six rings. A basketball trophy. A stadium deal. What gets you out of bed?

“I’m chasing greatness each day. That may sound cheesy but it’s a true statement. Specifically I want to make a positive impact on people I interact with and on a larger scale impact on the cities I’m working with.”

He connected it back to the walkout. Said the health crisis overreach came from the same place — wanting to impact the city, believing in the medical community, getting too excited about good news. “But I learned a valuable lesson of the damage I can do as well.”

Here’s what I know: Mike Paulson is complicated. He builds things. He breaks things. He wins championships in one city while another city wonders if he’s paying attention. He makes promises about shovels and jobs and being present three days a week.

Here’s what I don’t know: Whether the apology is the beginning of something or just a really good press conference.

But he came back. He faced the room. He said the words to my face.

That’s not nothing.

THE QUOTE THAT MATTERS

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports — Senior Historian

I’ve covered Mike Paulson for years. I’ve heard him talk about championships, rotations, player development, organizational philosophy. I’ve watched him build a dynasty and navigate its complications.

Tuesday, he said something I haven’t heard before.

“Oakland is home. This is where I plan to raise my family and retire someday.”

In all the pressers, all the availabilities, all the sidebar conversations — I don’t recall Paulson ever framing Oakland as his personal future. The franchise’s home, yes. The organization’s commitment, yes. But his family? His retirement?

That’s different.

Maybe it’s just a good line. Maybe it’s what you say when you’ve spent months in Chicago and need to reassure the city that traded you its attention. Maybe it’s politics.

But I’ve been around long enough to know when someone means something. And when Anthony asked him point-blank — “Are you back? Is this home again?” — Paulson didn’t hesitate.

The dynasty celebration he announced will bring back championship-era players. Keane gets his farewell. Dillon gets honored. The youth get shown what the expectation is.

That’s not a GM passing through. That’s a GM planting flags.

We’ll see if the flag holds.

PAULSON BREAKS SILENCE ON OAKLAND WALKOUT
First public acknowledgment of health crisis misstep comes from Chicago podium

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — Mike Paulson addressed the Oakland press conference walkout for the first time Tuesday, calling his comments during the city's ongoing health crisis "insensitive" and acknowledging he "overstepped" when speaking on the situation.

"I'll admit there were some unfortunate circumstances," Paulson said from the United Center press room, where he had gathered to discuss the Bulls' NBA Cup semifinal run. "I misspoke on the health crisis when I should have kept my enthusiasm to my faith in the Oakland health community's ability to handle the situation."

It was the first time the dual-franchise executive has publicly addressed the incident, which saw him abruptly leave a presser weeks ago after questions about Oakland's health situation turned pointed. The silence that followed stretched across multiple cycles while Temescal and other neighborhoods continued reporting elevated illness rates.

"I realize the health crisis is still lingering and I shouldn't have spoken on the topic," Paulson continued. "I acknowledge the insensitivity of the conversation and the conversation taking on a tone I felt I needed to just remove myself from."

When pressed for a direct message to Oakland residents still dealing with health concerns, Paulson pivoted to support.

"My message to anyone still dealing with the crisis is to seek local health services and make sure these cases are logged so the proper treatment is rolled out. I continue to support the health community in every way I'm able."

The acknowledgment came during what was otherwise a celebratory availability. The Bulls sit one win from the NBA Cup Finals, a position no one projected for the young franchise entering the season. But the Oakland questions found their way into the room — as they always do when Paulson takes a podium in either city.

Asked directly about his whereabouts if Chicago closes out its semifinal while spring training opens in Mesa, Paulson offered only: "My role is and will always be to serve the teams and put the best products forward. Wherever that takes me, that's where I'll be."

The non-answer satisfied no one. But the walkout acknowledgment gave Oakland something it hadn't received in weeks: a response.

BULLS ONE WIN AWAY — PAULSON TEMPERS EXPECTATIONS DESPITE SURGE

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The Bulls are one game from the NBA Cup Finals. Mike Paulson isn't ready to call it a arrival.

"I can admit we are operating a bit ahead of even my expectations," Paulson said Tuesday. "We aren't shying away from the success but also are tempering expectations with such a young core."

That core — Josh Giddey, Matas Buzelis (21), Hank Trepagnier (21), and Adash Stanley (19) — has exceeded every external projection. Giddey is flirting with triple-double averages. Trepagnier has emerged as the most efficient big man in the Eastern Conference. Stanley, the 19-year-old spark plug from Poland, has provided energy off the bench that veteran teams can't match.

"We plan to develop these young players this season," Paulson said. "We've accumulated draft picks already. We will build and strike to add when the opportunity lends itself."

The timeline question looms over everything. Is this a team built to win now, or is the Cup run ahead of schedule?

Paulson's answer suggested the latter — but with no intention of pumping the brakes.

"As we've shown in Oakland, we plan to develop," he said, invoking the A's dynasty model that has defined his executive career. The implication was clear: Chicago is the second franchise built in that image. The system travels.

Veterans like Kevin Huerter have helped stabilize the locker room, Paulson noted, keeping daily routines intact while the young players handle the spotlight.

The city has noticed. Energy in Chicago is different. Conversations have shifted. Belief has returned to a franchise that spent years wandering.

One win away. No one saw it coming — including, by his own admission, the man running both teams.

MEANWHILE IN MESA: CLUBHOUSE WAITS, QUESTIONS LINGER

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Mike Paulson praised Deacon Seymour from a podium 1,800 miles away Tuesday. The clubhouse in Mesa is still waiting to hear it in person.

"We are extremely excited for what Deacon brings to the A's," Paulson said during his Chicago availability, deferring deeper comments to "the coming weeks." He acknowledged reports of the lineup leak that undermined Seymour's first days as manager but offered little clarity.

"I'm aware of the reporting thus far, but I also have my own experiences of seeing him with the team," Paulson said.

Spring training opens this week. Seymour has never managed a professional game. The roster is talented but watching. The front office is present but the GM is in Chicago, addressing walkouts and celebrating a basketball team's unexpected rise.

When asked directly when he'd land in Arizona, Paulson sidestepped.

The A's have operated in silence for cycles. Paulson's acknowledgment of the Oakland walkout may provide closure on one front. But the baseball questions remain open.

Mesa waits.

HE SAID THE WORDS. NOW WHAT?

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

He finally said it.

Not from Oakland. Not from the Coliseum. Not from anywhere that smells like the Bay. From Chicago. From a basketball podium. From the city that's getting the version of Mike Paulson that shows up for the bright lights.

"Insensitive." His word. "Overstepped." His word.

Look, I'm not here to pile on. The man acknowledged what happened. That's more than we've gotten in weeks. The walkout hung over everything — the health crisis still unresolved, the questions still unanswered, and the GM just... gone.

Now he's back. Sort of. On a screen. From a press room where they're celebrating a basketball team we're supposed to care about because his name is attached.

And maybe that's the tension we're all going to have to live with. Paulson built something here. The A's are his. The system is his. The dynasty — if we're still calling it that — is his. But attention is finite. You can only be in one room at a time.

He said when asked about where he'd be if the Bulls close it out: "Wherever that takes me, that's where I'll be."

That's the answer. That's always been the answer. We just didn't want to hear it.

Spring training opens. Deacon Seymour's got questions. The clubhouse has questions. Oakland has questions.

Paulson gave us two words from Chicago: insensitive and overstepped.

He's not wrong. But words from 1,800 miles away only go so far.

CITY BUZZING, BUT OAKLAND'S GHOST IN THE ROOM

By Talia Finch | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The United Center press room was supposed to be about basketball. For twenty minutes, it almost was.

Paulson fielded questions about the young core, the development timeline, the unexpected Cup run. He praised Giddey. He credited Huerter. He talked about the system he built in Oakland finally showing up on a second coast.

Then Oakland showed up in a different way.

The walkout question landed like a change in air pressure. Paulson didn't dodge. He didn't deflect. He took it.

The room shifted. Chicago media — there for basketball — watched the Bay Tribune reporters pull the conversation somewhere else entirely. This is what covering Paulson means now. Two cities. Two franchises. Two sets of unfinished business in every room he enters.

He left the podium without committing to either city for the next week. Spring training or Cup Finals. A's or Bulls. The man who built a dynasty by being everywhere is now stretched between two places that both need him present.

Chicago got the words today. The energy. The answers.

Oakland got an apology from 1,800 miles away.

MIKE PAULSON PRESS CONFERENCE — OAKLAND(Transcript)
Post-Cycle 73.txt 
| A’s Spring Training Media Availability
Location: Oakland Athletics Media Room

Paulson steps to the podium. First time on an Oakland stage since the walkout. The room is smaller than Chicago — no national cameras, no basketball buzz. Just the beat writers who’ve been waiting.

Anthony, Bay Tribune Sports — Lead A’s Beat:
“Mike, welcome back. Last time you stood at an Oakland podium, you walked out. You addressed it from Chicago, but this is the first time you’re facing this room directly. What do you want to say to Oakland — not about basketball, not about the stadium — about what happened?”

I’d like to address this off the bat and just express my regret on how I reacted to the situation.  I acted poorly in the moment and Oakland citizens certainly deserve more than that.  I shouldn’t have made predictions on the health crisis and been overly enthusiastic about an end to it. The line of questioning turned to how I knew this when I should’ve just kept my support to the medical community and not minimizing the situation with a prediction

Anthony nods, scribbles notes. The room is quiet. A few beats pass before the next question.

Anthony, Bay Tribune Sports — Follow-up:
“Appreciated. Moving to baseball — Deacon Seymour has never managed a professional game. You praised him from Chicago, but you haven’t been in Mesa. Spring training opens against San Diego. Will you be there for his first game, and what’s your honest assessment of where he is as a first-year manager?”

Yeah , I’ll just tell you I’m a huge fan of Deacon . I understand the concerns but I’m confident in his abilities. I couple that with having a young nucleus that’s ready to win . I’m  encourage this will be the case . Also , it’s untrue to suggest I gar not been to Mesa.  I am able to manage my time effectively to be in Mesa 3 days a week and Chicago 3 days a week. Of course my office is with me 7 days. Time will tell on that story and I understand the concerns. We are taking all precautions to ensure success

Anthony raises an eyebrow at the Mesa correction, makes a note. A few reporters exchange glances — that travel schedule hasn’t been reported.

Hal Richmond, Bay Tribune Sports — Senior Historian:
“Mike, this roster on paper might be the most talented you’ve ever assembled. Rivas, Coles, Davis coming back, Keane’s final year, Dillon returning. But the ALCS loss to Boston exposed depth concerns when injuries hit. What’s different about 2041 that makes you believe this group gets over the hump?”

I’d agree with that assessment and specifically I’d point to pitching depth . We played too may games these past playoffs where the offense was carrying the load . A lot 8 to 9 run games. If we limit some of those the 7 we score looks alot better . That’s why we took some big swings this offseason adding a second Ace having a very productive Dillon take the 5 spot in the rotation. Take a swing a young hot shot closer while also adding a top 20 pitching prospect.  The truth of the matter is we have more depth in the farm than the roster. This offseason we escalated a few positions is all . The bullpen is uber talented so we just have to get the mix set even if that means making moves in season

Hal nods approvingly — the old historian appreciates a GM who talks pitching depth. P Slayer leans forward in his seat.

P Slayer, Fan Columnist:
“Mike. Six World Series rings. NBA Cup trophy. Stadium deal that doesn’t cost taxpayers a dime. You’re splitting time between two cities, two sports, two franchises. I wrote a column asking what you actually want at this point. So I’m asking you directly: What’s the thing that gets you out of bed? What are you chasing?”

P , I’m surprised you’re letting me off the hook on the health crisis fiasco . I know I walked out on your questioning and honestly I’m most ashamed of that . You are the heart of the cities passion and I didnt honor that . I sincerely apologize.  I’m chasing greatest each day . That may sound cheesy but it’s a true statement. Specifically I want to make a positive impact on people I interact with and on a larger scale impact on the cities I’m working with. I see the impact successful sports or just business can have on a society . It’s why i overstepped on the health crisis. I got a bit over excited about my belief in these medical comm unities but learned a valuable lesson of the damage I can do as well

P Slayer sits back. The room is silent for a moment — nobody expected Paulson to go there unprompted. P Slayer gives a small nod, something unreadable crossing his face. He doesn’t follow up.

Carmen Delaine, Bay Tribune Civic:
“The Baylight District agreement is the biggest stadium news Oakland’s had in years. But Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei — your lead negotiator on this — has been hospitalized since Cycle 72. No updates on his condition. Can you speak to how this deal came together, who stepped in, and whether you have any information on Osei’s status?”

We always saw Oakland as home. When the LasVegas deal fell through we were pleased to be able to play in Arizona Diamondbacks stadium but now we are ready to take Oakland back . I have to admit the Mayor has been a huge advocate for the project and lesser known hero on this is Mark Aitken. I will tell you Mark is a future politician. The fans and citizens of Oakland wanting it is probably the biggest reason.  Marcus is a very close friend and news has been scarce on his situation but I’ve been in contact and he wanted me to share an update . Marcus was in a traffic collision and has been hospitalized for a few cycles now. He’s on the mend and doing some recovery . That’s about all I can share right now

Carmen’s pen stops. That’s the first public confirmation of what happened to Osei. Reporters are already texting editors. She presses forward.

Carmen Delaine, Bay Tribune Civic — Follow-up:
“Thank you for that update — I know the city’s been wondering. One more on Baylight: the plan goes to the City Planning Committee next. You’re asking for tax exemptions rather than public funding. What happens if the committee says no? Is there a backup plan, or is this the only path back to Oakland?”

I’m glad to be able to share the update and will say Osei is a tough one and he already is trying to work and serve the community.  We feel the tax plan is fair and we are not looking for a set rate . We believe this plan is more inline with the city success than the e franchise.

Carmen nods, finishes her notes. The Osei news will lead tonight — but there’s more ground to cover.

Luis Navarro, Bay Tribune Investigations:
“Mike, migration drift hit -45 this cycle. Worst reading we’ve tracked. West Oakland is emptying out — storefronts dark, families leaving. You’re promising a stadium, but that’s years away. People are leaving now. What’s your message to residents who feel like the city is being left behind while the focus is on deals and championships elsewhere?”

Unfortunately I don’t think I’m the best situated to speak on that but I’d say that a stadium may be a couple years away but the jobs are not . As soon as we are able shovels are hitting dirt , stimulation starts

Luis writes it down but doesn’t look satisfied. He lets it go — for now.

Mags Corliss, Bay Tribune Sports — Managing Editor:
“Mike, Vinnie Keane announced this is his final season. The man’s been here a decade, six championships, face of the franchise. How involved will you be in making sure his farewell gets the send-off it deserves? And has there been any conversation about what comes next for him — coaching, front office, anything to keep him in Oakland green and gold?”

Vinnie is a man of many fames as we all know so he most definitely will have all his options available to him . I’m sure he could play a few more years if he wanted too. We’d love to have Vinnie here but may be too hard to keep him from the national media camera.  And yes this will be a season dedicated to Vinnie and we will also be doing some stuff for Benji .

Mags smiles slightly — she knows the Keane family well. The Benji mention catches a few ears.

Anthony, Bay Tribune Sports — Follow-up:
“You mentioned Benji. He just made the cover of Science Monthly for his water filtration work — second time on that cover. He’s 38, one-year deal, slotting into the five spot. Is this a farewell tour for Dillon too? And does he know that’s how the organization sees it?”

Benji is the smartest person I’ve spent this much time next too. He’s on a different level mentally haha. I wouldn’t call it a farewell but we will be honoring the Dynasty with Keane retirement so naturally Benji will be apart of that . We will also be bringing older players from those runs and honoring it all. The vision that’s clear to all we are showing the youth what the expectation is

Anthony nods — that’s a good quote. The dynasty celebration angle is new information.

P Slayer, Fan Columnist — Second question:
“You mentioned showing the youth the expectation. Danny Horn told us he thinks he’s the best player in baseball. Straight up said it. His numbers back it up — .280, 32 homers, 35 steals, 8.0 WAR. Do you agree with him? And how do you manage that kind of confidence in a clubhouse with veterans like Keane and Dillon?”

Horn is a perfectionist so it’s on par to make those claims as if he doesn’t believe it then it can’t be true. I do agree with Horn being the most talent athlete and all around best player in the league . We try to managing winning and winning backs down to no one

P Slayer grins — that’s the quote he wanted. A GM backing his player’s boldest claim.

Dr. Lila Mezran, Bay Tribune Health Desk:
“Mike, I have to ask. The health situation in Temescal is entering its fifth week. You addressed this crisis once before — by your own admission today, poorly. The community is now organizing mutual aid networks because official answers haven’t come. I’m not asking you to make predictions this time. I’m asking: as someone who employs people who live in these neighborhoods, who runs a franchise that depends on this city’s health — what is the A’s organization actually doing to support residents right now?”

As a resident of Oakland I too am concerned and focused on what I can do to help start getting some resolve and understanding. I think the part that has people worried is the unknown nature of the crisis. The medical community has done a brilliant job keeping the cases from escalating in severity. As an organization we will have players visiting local hospitals and clinics , we will be, we also will be running informative media spots featuring players to raise awareness. We stand by ready and willing to do our part as a Pilar if the community

Dr. Mezran writes carefully. It’s a measured answer — no predictions this time, concrete actions promised. She nods once.

Hal Richmond, Bay Tribune Sports — Final question:
“Mike, last one. Elliott Crane — Business Caucus Leader on the City Council — has also been out since Cycle 72. Listed as injured. You just gave us news on Osei. Any word on Crane? And more broadly: two civic officials down at the same time the city is trying to push through a major stadium deal. Does that concern you about the timeline?”

Unfortunately I don’t have any news on Elliot at this time but he can that we expect to have him back at work soon.  No not concerned as this has been in the works for sometime so the structure has been mostly in place. That said we would most definitely benefit from being at full strength but like our teams sometimes you have to make do with who’s available.

Hal nods — the “next man up” framing is pure Paulson.

Anthony, Bay Tribune Sports — Closing:
“Last question, Mike. You’re here. You apologized. You gave us news on Osei, updates on the roster, backed Danny Horn’s claim. But I have to ask the simple one: Are you back? Not three days a week in Mesa, not splitting time — are you back in Oakland? Is this home again?”

Oakland is home. This is where I plan to raise my family and retire someday.

The room holds for a moment. Paulson steps back from the podium. Cameras click. The beat writers are already heading for the doors, phones out, filing alerts.
