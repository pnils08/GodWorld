📰 Letters from the Golden Era – Part I

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune | Spring 2040

There are mornings when the Bay feels quieter than it should. The gulls circle the pier, the tide murmurs against the pilings, and for a moment you could believe the world never sped up. I used to drive the same stretch of Embarcadero before games at the Coliseum, coffee cooling in the cup holder, radio low, the day just beginning to hum. The team was still golden then — not only for the wins, but for the light they cast across a city still trying to remember how to love itself.

From 2027 through 2035 we called it the dynasty, though most of us knew dynasties are only named after they end. Vinnie Keane was the anchor; Dillon’s arm was the metronome; Kelley and Aitken were the quiet architects who made every inning feel inevitable. They didn’t just win — they steadied the town. The banners went up, sure, but what stayed were the small things: the barber in Jack London Square painting green stripes on the windows, the old woman selling peanuts on Fifth Street, the kids wearing hand-drawn “Underdog Slugger” shirts to school.

Now, when I pass the old ballpark site — half-demolished, half-reborn — I still hear the echo. Maybe that’s why I keep writing these letters: to remind the next generation that the calm and the storm were never separate things. They were the same heartbeat, thumping through the decades, reminding us that hope isn’t something you chase; it’s something you remember.

End of Part I.
