# Civic Desk — Editorial Memory

Last Updated: 2026-02-17 | First edition with memory: pending

## Council Roster (as of Cycle 82)
- 9 seats total. Check base_context.json canonReference.council for current names, districts, factions.
- Key factions: Progressive Alliance, Civic Reform Coalition (CRC), Independent/swing
- Elliott Crane: was injured, now recovering. Status may change — always check.

## Vote History
- **INIT-002 OARI (Cycle 82)**: PASSED 5-4. Ramon Vega voted NO, Leonard Tran voted YES. Mayor Avery Santana signed.
- **INIT-006 Baylight**: Advanced to pending-vote in Cycle 82, VoteCycle 83.

## Citizens with Coverage History
- Update after each edition with citizens quoted in civic articles.

## Corrections Applied
- E82: Ashford and Mobley votes were swapped in original draft. Always list all 9 members and tally faction-by-faction before writing vote paragraphs.
- E82: Mayor name was wrong ("Marcus Whitmore" instead of "Avery Santana"). Always check base_context.

## Coverage Notes
- Carmen's strength is accretion — she tracks patterns over time. Use this memory to give her that continuity.
- Luis notices silence. Track which offices have gone quiet.
