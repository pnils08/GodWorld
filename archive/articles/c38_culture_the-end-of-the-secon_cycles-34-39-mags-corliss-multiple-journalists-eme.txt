“Four Hundred People in a Room Full of Questions No One Could Answer”
The Emergency Town Briefing at the Frank Ogawa Plaza Community Center on the evening of Cycle 38 felt less like information dissemination and more like collective grief processing.
Four hundred residents. Fifty folding chairs. Standing room only. The kind of density that would normally trigger fire code concerns, but given the circumstances—six neighborhoods under health advisories, cognitive disruption episodes spreading faster than explanations—nobody mentioned capacity limits.
Shawna Delgado, Emergency Director, stood at the podium with Dr. Patricia Nwosu and Lt. Marcus Vega flanking her. Three agencies. One message: We’re working on it.
“Good evening. Thank you for coming. We know you have questions. We’re going to provide everything we know, and we’re going to be honest about what we don’t know.”
The room appreciated the honesty. Didn’t make the not-knowing easier.
Carmen Vega, 41, candle vendor from earlier Winter Riverfront Festival reporting, attended with her seven-year-old daughter:
“I needed to hear it directly. Not from social media. Not from neighbors speculating. I needed someone official to tell me whether my daughter is safe going to school. That’s all I wanted to know.”
The briefing lasted ninety minutes. Dr. Nwosu presented the medical data. Lt. Vega covered public safety protocols. Shawna Delgado coordinated Q&A.
The questions came fast:
“Is this contagious?”
“We have no evidence of person-to-person transmission.”
“Is it in the water?”
“Water testing shows no contaminants.”
“Should we leave Oakland?”
(Pause) “That’s a personal decision. We’re not recommending evacuation.”
“When will you know what’s causing this?”
“We’re working with state and federal health agencies. Timeline uncertain.”
That last answer landed heavy.
Marcus Walker, 48, dishwasher from Jack London (quoted in previous reporting):
“I understand they don’t have answers yet. I do. But hearing ‘timeline uncertain’ when your neighborhood just got added to the list? That’s not reassuring. That’s terrifying.”
The second briefing, Cycle 39, had similar attendance but different energy. Less fear. More anger.
Resident question (unidentified): “Six neighborhoods in two weeks. How many more before you declare an emergency?”
Shawna Delgado: “We have declared an emergency. These briefings are part of our emergency response protocol.”
Same resident: “Then why isn’t anything changing?”
Shawna Delgado: “We’ve implemented workplace safety protocols, enhanced medical monitoring, and coordinated with every relevant agency. What specific action would you like to see?”
Same resident: “I want to know what’s happening to us.”
Silence. Because nobody in that room—not the Emergency Director, not the Deputy Health Officer, not the police lieutenant—could answer that question.
Jasmine Okafor, 35, who attended the Winter Riverfront Festival with her daughters:
“My youngest asked me after the briefing: ‘Are the grown-ups scared?’ I told her no. But I was lying. The grown-ups are terrified. We just don’t want the kids to know.”
What struck me most wasn’t what was said. It was what people did after.
Nobody left immediately. Four hundred people stayed in that room, talking to each other, forming clusters of conversation. Neighbors who’d never met exchanged phone numbers. Parents coordinated school pickup networks. Someone started a group text for Fruitvale residents.
The briefing didn’t provide answers. But it provided something else: witness.
Four hundred people who’d been experiencing something strange, scary, and isolating suddenly realized they weren’t alone.
Tyrell Mason, 28, musician from earlier reporting:
“I’ve had two episodes since Cycle 34. Both times I thought I was losing my mind. Being in that room with four hundred other people who’ve experienced the same thing? That doesn’t make it less scary. But it makes it less lonely.”
By the end of the second briefing, residents had self-organized:
	•	Neighborhood watch networks for episode reporting
	•	Buddy systems for people living alone
	•	School pickup cooperatives for parents who experience episodes
	•	Crisis hotline volunteer groups
The city provided information. The community provided structure.
Shawna Delgado, after the second briefing:
“This is what Oakland does. We don’t panic. We adapt. We organize. I wish I had better answers for them. But I’m grateful they’re not waiting for permission to take care of each other.”
The third briefing is scheduled for Cycle 41. Attendance expected to exceed five hundred.
