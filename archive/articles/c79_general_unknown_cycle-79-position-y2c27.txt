CYCLE 79 POSITION: Y2C27
UPCOMING VOTES:
	∙	Cycle 80: Temescal Health Center (5-4) — next cycle
	∙	Cycle 82: OARI (5-4) — true toss-up
	∙	Cycle 83: Baylight Final (5-4) — likely passes
ACTIVE ARCS:
	∙	Stabilization Fund just passed (C78) — implementation begins, first disbursements within 45 days
	∙	Crane crossover fallout — CRC fractured, no public explanation yet
	∙	OPOA pressure campaign — Ramirez town hall in D4 targeting Vega
	∙	Lake Merritt inflow strain — new arc from Agent Edition

EDITORIAL GUIDANCE — CYCLE 79
Primary coverage: Post-Stabilization fallout. The vote happened. Now what?
	∙	West Oakland reaction — relief, skepticism, “show me the check” voices
	∙	Crane’s silence — CRC hasn’t responded publicly. Ashford and Chen declined comment. That’s a story.
	∙	Implementation timeline — Carter said 45 days to first disbursements. City administrator’s office is now in charge.
Secondary coverage: Health Center approaching (C80)
	∙	Temescal mood — the vote is next cycle. How does the neighborhood feel?
	∙	Ashford position — it’s in his district (D7) but he’s been skeptical. Does he support it?
Background: OARI pressure continues
	∙	Ramirez campaign building
	∙	Vega under fire but hasn’t committed

STATEMENTS NEEDED?
I don’t think we need official district statements for C79. The Stabilization Fund just passed — let the newsroom cover the reaction organically.
However: If you want to seed the Health Center debate for C80, a statement from Ashford’s office (D7) would be useful. Something noncommittal that Carmen can write about — “Councilmember Ashford continues to review the appropriation proposal” — that lets the newsroom build tension before the vote.
No new initiatives should hit the floor this cycle. Let the world breathe.
