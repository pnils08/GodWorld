“When the Light Comes Back: Benji Dillon and the Weight of Memory”
The lobby of the Coliseum smells different in November. The championship banners hang in their places, but there’s a particular quality to the light when a season ends without adding another. Benji Dillon walked through those doors as a returning son in February 2040, and by October, he’d learned what every prodigal discovers: you can’t actually go home.
But you can try.
Twenty-four million dollars says the front office believed in something—not the 82 overall rating, not the diminished velocity, but the institutional memory of what a Cy Young winner looks like when the pressure builds in October. Dillon went 10-10 with a 4.29 ERA in the regular season. Those are not ace numbers. Those are not even particularly good numbers.
But in Game 1 of the ALCS, Henry Rivas gave up three runs. In Game 2, Arturo Ramos—the All-Star—couldn’t hold. By Game 3, with the series slipping into darkness at 0-2, Oakland turned to what Oakland has always turned to when the moment demands it: the Golden Arm.
Dillon delivered seven shutout innings in Game 4. Not vintage. Not 2034. But enough. Oakland won 4-1. Then 6-2 in Game 5. The light came back briefly.
What happened in Games 6 and 7 remains, as of this writing, unrecorded in the packet. Perhaps that’s appropriate. Some endings write themselves in the spaces between data points.
Benji Dillon returned to Oakland to save something. Whether he succeeded depends on what you believe needed saving.
