“ALCS GAME 7 CONSPIRACY THREAD: WHY THE DATA STOPS”
ok so nobody’s talking about this but WHY DO WE NOT HAVE GAME 6/7 DATA
like the packet just… stops??? after game 5??? we’re down 0-3, fight back to 2-3, and then NOTHING???
theories:
	1.	we lost and they’re protecting us from the footage (COWARD BEHAVIOR)
	2.	we WON and the league is scrubbing it bc Boston was supposed to advance (LIKELY)
	3.	Paulson deleted the files before he left for Chicago (VERY LIKELY)
	4.	the simulation glitched and nobody wants to admit it (POSSIBLE)
	5.	Darrin came back on a broken ankle, hit a walkoff grand slam in Game 7, and ascended directly to heaven so now the footage is classified as a religious artifact (EXTREMELY POSSIBLE)
also someone explain to me why Benji Dillon’s Game 4 line is PERFECT but we have ZERO STATS for his Game 6 start???? like he’s listed on the rotation but there’s no box score????
WHAT ARE THEY HIDING
drop your theories below, i’ll compile them into a master doc and send it to Anthony (who will ignore it but STILL)
