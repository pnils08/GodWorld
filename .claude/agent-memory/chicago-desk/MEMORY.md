# Chicago Desk — Editorial Memory

Last Updated: 2026-02-17 | First edition with memory: pending

## Bulls Roster Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Watch for real NBA name leaks. E82 had "Josh Smith" which should be "Jalen Smith" (our canon). If a name sounds like a real NBA player but isn't in the packet roster, FLAG IT.
- Mike Paulson: dual-GM (A's and Bulls). The tension between Oakland and Chicago is a recurring thread.
- Always verify Bulls record against Chicago_Sports_Feed before writing.

## Chicago Citizens (Talia's Sources)
- Update after each edition with Chicago neighborhood citizens Talia has quoted.

## Venue Continuity
- Romano's on 35th — established in Talia's voice profile. Can be reused.
- Track other specific venues used so they stay consistent.

## Corrections Applied
- E82: Real NBA name leaked in (Josh Smith → Jalen Smith). Always check roster data.

## Coverage Notes
- Selena: third person analyst. Stats, trades, roster construction. Backs claims with evidence.
- Talia: first person observer. Sensory details, specific people, specific places. "I" as witness only.
- Use CHICAGO weather, not Oakland weather.
- Chicago neighborhoods: Bridgeport (Paulson's), Bronzeville, Loop, Pilsen, Lincoln Park.
