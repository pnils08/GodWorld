BENJI DILLON — FULL EXPANDED INTERVIEW + DUGOUT SCENE + INDEX

Interview Feature (Expanded)

P Slayer: They call it a golden arm. What do you call it?
Benji Dillon: A schedule. Everyone wants to label talent when it’s really routine. Twenty years of throwing when I didn’t want to. That’s the real gold.

P Slayer: But your games don’t look routine.
Benji: That’s because routine carries the weight so the moment doesn’t have to. If you feel your mechanics on game day, you lost the fight already. I want the game to feel like the easiest part of my week.

P Slayer: You’ve said before you “respect decline.” Most athletes avoid even saying the word.
Benji: Decline isn’t an insult. It’s gravity. You only fear it when you lie about it. My job is to stay ahead of it. Keep the joints clean. Keep the angles sharp. Pitching is a rental. I’m just taking care of the property while I’ve got it.

P Slayer: Do you fear anything out there?
Benji: Noise. Not crowd noise—inner noise. The stuff that talks when the count is full. When I’m right, the only thing in my head is the math of the pitch. If I reach nothingness? That hitter doesn’t stand a chance.

P Slayer: Last thing. When the mound is quiet—dead quiet—what fills your head?
Benji: Math first. Then sunlight. Then nothing.

Dugout Interview Scene — Photo-Ready Prompt

Scene Prompt:
Benji Dillon in the Oakland Athletics dugout one hour before first pitch. He’s in full uniform, legs relaxed, forearm resting on his thigh. A copy of Science Monthly with his face on the cover sits beside him. P Slayer stands next to him holding a microphone or recorder, mid-question. Lighting is warm late-afternoon sun cutting across the dugout edge. Shallow depth of field; field visible behind them with a few players stretching. Realistic sports-photography style; candid, grounded mood.
