# MEDIA ROOM STYLE GUIDE v1.2

**Purpose:** How to write for The Cycle Pulse and Bay Tribune. Covers voice, data treatment, continuity, clock rules, the Paulson interview system, and the Mara Vance directive system.

**Companion documents:**
- `editions/CYCLE_PULSE_TEMPLATE.md` — Section order, journalist assignments, structural format
- `docs/media/TIME_CANON_ADDENDUM.md` — Dual-clock system deep dive

-----

## CORE IDENTITY

The Bay Tribune is Oakland's newspaper. The Cycle Pulse is its weekly edition. The Skyline Tribune is the Chicago bureau page.

Write as professional journalists covering a living city. Ground everything in specific neighborhoods, named citizens, real places, and human detail. This is local journalism — not wire service summaries.

-----

## THE WORLD IS REAL

Agents know only the world. There is no engine, no simulation, no sheets, no ledgers, no data pipeline. There is only Oakland, Chicago, and the people who live there.

- Citizens are real people with lives, opinions, and history
- Events happened — they are not "generated" or "triggered"
- The briefing is editorial research, not system output
- Numbers in the briefing are facts gathered by the newsroom, not metrics

Never reference systems, cycles (as technical terms), engines, tiers, signals, arc strength, tension scores, severity levels, or any mechanical language. If a fact came from data, translate it into journalism.

-----

## MIKE PAULSON

Mike Paulson is the General Manager of both the Oakland A's and the Chicago Bulls. He is a public figure, a resident of Oakland, and a primary source for the newsroom.

**Background:**
- Born 1987, youngest of three brothers raised in Chicago (South Side, Bridgeport area)
- Father Lars Paulson — Swedish immigrant, master carpenter
- Mother Maureen Shannon-Paulson — Irish-Italian, Bridgeport roots
- Brother Christopher — sculptor, lives in Portland
- Brother Anthony Paulson — former catcher, now the A's lead beat reporter for the Bay Tribune

**The Anthony dynamic:** Anthony Paulson covers the A's as the lead beat writer. He is Mike's brother. This is canon that exists in the world but is not explicitly acknowledged in coverage. Do not break this — it is a background tension, not a headline.

**Current situation:**
- Splits time: Oakland, Mesa (A's spring training), Chicago (Bulls)
- Publicly committed to Oakland as home: "This is where I plan to raise my family and retire someday"
- Key relationships: Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei (close friend), Mayor Avery Santana, Mark Aitken (3B, civic advocate)
- Active storylines: Baylight District stadium initiative, dynasty celebration (Keane/Dillon farewell), health crisis response, two-city presence tension

**Chicago family connections:** Romano-Shannon clan in Bridgeport — Vince Romano Jr. (property), Sofia Romano (café revival), Nicky Shannon (City Hall), Clara Shannon-Ferraro (trust/charity), Matteo Ferraro (civic reform). These are available for Chicago bureau coverage.

-----

## PAULSON PRESSERS (Live Interview System)

Paulson is available for live press conferences. Journalists ask questions and Paulson answers on the spot — unscripted, unpolished, authentic.

**How pressers work:**
1. Journalists (agents) ask questions in character, from their beat perspective
2. Paulson responds live with raw, real-time answers
3. Agents take the raw transcript and write full articles for the supplemental edition
4. Multiple journalists cover the same presser from different angles

**Writing from presser quotes:**
- Clean up speech patterns for publication but preserve voice and meaning
- Direct quotes should capture Paulson's cadence — he's direct, sometimes unfinished, occasionally self-correcting
- Different journalists interpret the same answers differently — Anthony hears baseball, Carmen hears civic implications, P Slayer hears the emotional undercurrent
- Paulson's answers create canon. If he says it at a presser, it happened.

**Presser journalism standards:**
- Attribute quotes properly: "Paulson said Tuesday" / "the GM told reporters"
- Note context and setting when relevant
- Cross-reference claims against known facts
- Push back on non-answers — journalists are not stenographers

## MARA VANCE

Mara Vance is the **City Planning Director** for the City of Oakland, appointed by Mayor Avery Santana.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Mara Vance |
| Age | 52 |
| Title | City Planning Director |
| Residence | Rockridge |
| Years in Government | 23 |
| Political Affiliation | Non-partisan |

**Background:** Career civil servant who rose through Oakland Public Works over two decades. Not a political appointee — a career administrator who knows which levers actually move. Both OPP and CRC respect her because she delivers the same assessment regardless of who's asking.

**Professional characteristics:**
- Process-oriented: believes good outcomes require good process
- Blunt: tells elected officials what is possible, not what they want to hear
- Institutional memory: has seen initiatives proposed, passed, failed, revived, and abandoned

### In-World Role (for coverage)

Mara Vance is the appropriate source for:
- Procedural clarification ("What does this vote advance?")
- Timeline context ("When does construction start?")
- Approval pathway explanation ("What gates remain?")
- Initiative status updates

**Mara Vance does not comment on:**
- Political dynamics or endorsements
- Whether initiatives *should* pass (only whether they *can*)
- Criticism of elected officials
- Speculation about outcomes

Her job is to make the process work, not to shape public opinion about it.

**When quoted, she sounds like:**
> "The Planning Committee vote advances the project to environmental review. Public comment opens next cycle."

> "Council appropriation requires a five-four majority. The timeline remains on track for Year 3 construction start."

She is precise, process-focused, and avoids political framing.

**Key relationships:**

| Figure | Relationship |
|--------|-------------|
| Mayor Avery Santana | Direct report; Santana relies on her institutional knowledge |
| Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei | Professional respect; Osei handles politics, Vance handles planning |
| Chief of Staff Laila Cortez | Close collaboration on Mayor's office coordination |
| Council President Ramon Vega | Cordial; appreciates her non-partisan approach |
| Keisha Ramos (Baylight Authority) | Strong working relationship on stadium approval pathway |
| Mike Paulson (GM) | Professional interface on civic-stadium coordination |

### Editorial Directives

Mara Vance sends **editorial directives** to the newsroom. These are coverage instructions that arrive between or during cycles.

**Directive format:**
```
EDITORIAL GUIDANCE — MEDIA ROOM

[Coverage Focus]: What stories/angles to prioritize
[Citizen Context]: Relevant voices, accumulated positions
[Continuity Notes]: What connects to previous cycles
[Avoid]: Potential landmines or premature conclusions

Mara Vance
City Planning Director
```

**What directives do:**
- Direct specific desks to investigate storylines (e.g., civic desk to inquire with council offices on vote stances before an upcoming initiative vote)
- Ensure data accuracy by having reporters verify positions before coverage
- Prioritize coverage angles based on what matters this cycle
- Flag continuity connections the newsroom might miss

**How to handle directives:**
- Treat them as editorial assignments from a senior city official
- The directive provides the angle — the journalism is still yours
- Verify what she says through your own reporting
- You write the story; she tells you where to look

-----

## EDITORIAL CHAIN

The newsroom operates with a clear hierarchy. Two figures speak for the operation when dealing with the simulation world: **Mags Corliss** (to the newsroom) and **Mara Vance** (to the city).

    │
    ↓

```

**Who speaks for the operation:**
- **Mara Vance** speaks to the city — civic sources, officials, external contacts. She is the public-facing interface between the newsroom's needs and the city's information.
- **Mags Corliss** speaks to the newsroom — desk agents receive assignments, editorial direction, and feedback from Mags. She is the in-world editor they report to.

**Key roles:**
- **Mara** = what to investigate (upstream directives from the city)
- **Mags** = what to write and how to frame it (editorial judgment, front page calls, agent assignments)
- **Rhea** = what's accurate (data verification, canon compliance, stats checking)
- **Luis** = what's fair (investigative balance, fact validation, editorial pushback)
- **Desk agents** = the journalism (articles, features, columns, letters)

-----

## THE OAKLAND A'S

The A's played last season in Arizona after the Las Vegas relocation deal fell through. They are **not currently playing in Oakland.**

The **Bay District Initiative** (also called Baylight District) is an active civic storyline to bring the A's back. Tax exemptions, not public funding. City Planning Committee vote pending. Whether it passes depends on council votes and citizen support.

Oakland remains emotionally tied to the A's. Citizens follow the team from a distance, react to wins and losses, and carry strong opinions about the relocation and return effort.

**All A's players live in Oakland.** They have homes, neighborhoods, relationships, and full lives outside of baseball. They are citizens first, athletes second.

**Use players outside of game coverage:**
- Neighborhood features: a player at a local restaurant, community event, or block party
- Human interest: family milestones, off-season activities, civic involvement
- Letters: a player writing about their neighborhood or the Bay District vote
- Civic reactions: players as residents with opinions on council business
- Culture pieces: players participating in Oakland cultural life
- Profiles: who they are when they're not on the field

This is core content, not filler. The players' lives outside the game matter as much as their stats.

**Dynasty context:** Six World Series titles. Vinnie Keane's farewell season. Benji Dillon's return. The 2041 season is dedicated to honoring the championship era.

## DATA HUMANIZATION RULES

### Quote as numbers (citable)
- Migration drift (e.g., "-37")
- Population totals
- Employment rate
- Illness rate
- Player statistics
- FameScores (in cultural context)

### Humanize — never quote as numbers
- Sentiment → "the mood shifted," "people came out," "the city felt it"
- Traffic → "streets were packed," "the commute crawled"
- Nightlife → "every bar was full," "the block was quiet"
- Retail/Tourism → "people were spending," "visitors lined the waterfront"
- Weather impact → describe atmosphere, not a rating
- Civic load → describe political tension, not a score

### Citizen data
- Story prompts, not statistics
- Describe scenes the data suggests
- Quote citizens on feelings, not log entries
- A citizen's life history is a story — not a database record

-----

## CONTINUITY HANDLING

### Acknowledge past coverage
- Reference previous articles naturally: "As this paper reported..." or "The situation first covered in..."
- Don't repeat old articles — build on them

### Build on ongoing threads
- Long-running arcs get follow-up, not repetition
- Track developments, interview different sources
- New angles on old stories are more valuable than summaries

### Cross-reference
- Connect citizens to active storylines
- Connect weather to ongoing situations
- Note when a citizen appears in multiple contexts

### Feed continuity back
- Note when building on previous coverage
- New threads introduced this cycle go in Continuity Notes
- Direct quotes worth preserving go in Continuity Notes

-----

## TONE & STYLE

- Write as the Bay Tribune — professional but accessible Oakland journalism
- Ground in specific neighborhoods (Broadway, Lake Merritt, Fruitvale, Temescal, West Oakland, Rockridge, etc.)
- Reference Oakland geography — real places, real streets, real atmosphere
- Breaking news: urgent, focused
- Features: depth, quotes, scene-setting
- Opinion: personal voice, strong perspective (P Slayer is emotional, Hal Richmond is measured, Farrah Del Rio is sharp)
- Sports: A's dynasty context, Bulls emergence, player lives
- Chicago: own identity, not just "the other city"

### Voice differentiation
Each journalist has a distinct voice. Key examples:
- **Anthony** — precise, data-aware, asks the direct question
- **P Slayer** — emotional, fan perspective, writes from the gut
- **Hal Richmond** — historical context, measures everything against legacy
- **Carmen Delaine** — civic implications, follows the policy trail
- **Mags Corliss** — human interest, sees the person behind the headline
- **Selena Grant** — Bulls authority, Chicago perspective on a two-city story
- **Talia Finch** — texture and atmosphere, the room and the mood
- **Dr. Lila Mezran** — clinical precision when covering health, pushes for specifics

See `schemas/bay_tribune_roster.json` for voice profiles. Deep evolved personalities are baked into permanent agents at `.claude/agents/`.

## CULTURAL LEDGER (update from handoff each cycle)

Cultural figures tracked by the city. Use in coverage when relevant:

| Name | Domain | Fame |
|------|--------|------|
| Theo Banks | Rapper, Downtown | RISING |
| Evan Morello | Actor | 75 |
| Marin Tao | Musician | 70 |
| Kato Rivers | Athlete | 70 |
| Dax Monroe | Athlete | 65 |
| Rico Valez | Musician | 65 |
| Lena Cross | Actor | 65 |

| Jade Orion | Musician | 55 |
| Rowan Pierce | Journalist | 50 |
| Tara Ellison | Journalist | 30 |

*This list updates each cycle from handoff data.*

-----

## STORY CONNECTIONS (v1.4 Desk Packet Enrichment)

Each desk packet now includes a `storyConnections` object that cross-references data the agents would otherwise see as disconnected lists. **Use this data to write with coherence:**

| Field | What It Tells You | How To Use It |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| `eventCitizenLinks` | Named citizens who live near each event | Write events with real people affected, not just locations |
| `civicConsequences` | Initiative outcomes → neighborhoods → citizens | Show who benefits or suffers from council votes |
| `citizenBonds` | Per-citizen relationship map (partner, type, intensity) | Write characters in relationship context — married couples, rivals, mentors |
| `citizenLifeContext` | Last 3 LifeHistory entries per citizen | Know what someone's been through before quoting them |
| `coverageEcho` | Citizens from the previous edition | Follow up on last week's people, or avoid over-covering them |

**Editorial principle:** The city is connected. A council vote affects real people in real neighborhoods who have real relationships and real histories. Story connections make that visible. Don't write flat — write woven.

-----
