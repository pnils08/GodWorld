Isley Kelley — “The river teaches you the hop”

P Slayer: Mississippi boy makes good. What did the river teach you that coaches did not?
Isley: The river says keep moving even when nobody sees you. That is how a ground ball hops.
P Slayer: Your glove has a nickname. Truth?
Isley: The Machine. Not because it is perfect, because it shows up.
P Slayer: Dynasty years felt heavy or holy?
Isley: Work is holy when it is shared. Heavy is what we lift together.
P Slayer: Last thing you whisper before a big at‑bat.
Isley: Find the seam. Then be the seam.
