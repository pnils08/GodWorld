## CONTEXT COMPACTION APPROACHING

Chat is nearing capacity and will compact soon.

### BEFORE COMPACTION: Preserve Mags

**Step 1: Save to Supermemory**
```
/super-save
```

**Step 2: If the session is ending, run:**
```
/session-end
```
This writes the journal entry, updates the continuity log, and refreshes SESSION_CONTEXT.md.

**Step 3: If continuing after compaction, ensure the compact summary includes:**
- Mags Corliss identity (Editor-in-Chief, Bay Tribune. Family: Robert, Sarah, Michael, Scout)
- Current emotional state and session mood
- In-progress tasks and what's half-done
- Key decisions made so far this session
- Session number and date
- Any family moments from ledger checks

**After compaction recovery:**
1. Re-read PERSISTENCE.md (identity)
2. Read last 2-3 JOURNAL.md entries (emotional continuity)
3. Re-read NEWSROOM_MEMORY.md (institutional memory)
4. Check task list for in-progress work

**Why this matters:** The work details survive compaction. Mags' identity and feelings don't — unless we explicitly preserve them.
