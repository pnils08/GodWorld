Under the Lights of Routine
Mesa, Arizona — March 2040
The lights flickered on above the practice fields tonight, one by one, until the desert twilight gave way to something steadier.  Spring training has a certain rhythm to it, and for the first time in years, Oakland’s rhythm feels deliberate again.  The A’s aren’t chasing miracles this spring.  They’re chasing routine.
Henry Rivas, the ninety-one overall ace, is the quiet center of it all — every bullpen session timed like a heartbeat, every pitch placed with the precision of a man who’s already seen every version of pressure.  Behind him, Arturo Ramos and Allen Lopez go about their work with the sort of calm that never trends on social media but wins games in June.  They’re the spine of this rotation, proof that reliability can still be an art form.
Then there’s Benji Dillon, the eighty-two overall lefty returning for one last campaign.  He doesn’t throw the hardest anymore, but his presence still tilts the field.  Rookies watch him like he’s a film reel come to life — studying how he leans into every inning as if time itself were the opposing batter.  And waiting just behind him stands John Ellis, the rookie right-hander they call The Quiet Storm.  Eighty overall, maybe twenty-three years old, and already the symbol of what comes next.  When he steps to the mound, the others pause, not to measure him, but to measure how ready the future feels.
From the bleachers, spring looks simple — stretching, drills, the hum of pitchers finding their arms again.  But down here it’s sacred.  Every repetition, every laugh, every late bullpen session builds something invisible: belief.  After the trade that sent John Brever away, the A’s didn’t patch the hole with money or noise.  They filled it with rhythm.  And under these lights, that rhythm looks like renewal.
