# Shovels Cleared: Baylight Legal Instruments Filed, Construction Legally Authorized

**The largest redevelopment project in Oakland's history clears its final legal preconditions. Now the city waits for a construction calendar that hasn't been released.**

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Ledger

For three weeks after the Oakland City Council's 6-3 approval of the $2.1 billion Baylight District Development Bond, two pieces of paper separated the largest redevelopment project in the city's history from a single shovel of earth. On Friday, both were filed with the Baylight Redevelopment Authority.

Keisha Ramos, Director of the Baylight Redevelopment Authority, executed Instrument No. BD-83-REB — the Environmental Remediation Performance Bond Certificate — and received it into her own office, completing the last legal precondition attached to the council's August 12 authorization. Filed alongside it: Ordinance No. BD-83-TIF, the Tax Increment Financing framework prepared by Dr. Simone Ellis, Chief Legal Counsel to the City of Oakland.

The bond document states the conclusion without hedging: "The construction mobilization condition is fulfilled. Construction mobilization may proceed subject to all other applicable permits and approvals."

**The Two Instruments**

The TIF ordinance establishes a 30-year financing zone across all 65 acres of the approved redevelopment boundary. Every property tax dollar generated above the district's current assessed value — the base year, fixed by the Alameda County Assessor's Office — flows exclusively into the Baylight Infrastructure Fund. The fund has one permitted purpose: servicing bond obligations and building the public infrastructure the development requires.

The authorized use list runs to eight categories: environmental remediation, shoreline stabilization and sea-level rise mitigation, water and sewer systems, utility installation, transit integration — including the dedicated BART pedestrian bridge, ferry terminal expansion, and AC Transit priority lanes — roadway improvements, stadium-adjacent public works and open space, and administrative costs of the Redevelopment Authority, capped at 3% of annual increment revenue. The Independent Audit Commission conducts annual reviews. The Community Benefits Oversight Board receives quarterly infrastructure spending reports.

The remediation bond, reviewed for legal sufficiency by Ellis and confirmed by Dr. Leanne Wu, Director of the Office of Environmental Review and Sustainability, holds the Baylight Private Development Consortium to a specific standard. The bond amount equals the independently verified remediation cost estimate — prepared by the Office of Environmental Review and Sustainability — plus a contingency reserve of not less than 15%. "No public liability exposure shall attach to the City of Oakland under this instrument," the certificate states. "All remediation costs are the sole obligation of the Principal and, in the event of default, the Surety."

The bond scope covers soil excavation and hazardous material abatement, groundwater monitoring wells, and shoreline stabilization — work identified by the 252-page Draft Environmental Impact Report that entered public circulation before the council vote. The bond remains in force until Wu's office formally certifies environmental clearance.

**From Vote to Ground**

The council's 6-3 approval — YES from Denise Carter (D1), Leonard Tran (D2), Rose Delgado (D3), Ramon Vega (D4), Janae Rivers (D5), and Terrence Mobley (D9); NO from Elliott Crane (D6), Warren Ashford (D7), and Nina Chen (D8) — came with explicit conditions. Ellis disclosed at the time of the vote that TIF legislative language was not complete and the remediation bonding instrument had not been executed. Construction could not mobilize until both conditions were satisfied.

Both conditions are now satisfied. The twelve-year phased development timeline begins, on paper, from the date the instruments were filed.

What the instruments do not contain: a construction start date. A permit calendar. A milestone schedule with accountability attached.

Shawn Nguyen, a 43-year-old construction laborer from Fruitvale who has tracked the Baylight environmental review since the document dropped, said it plainly. "Filing documents isn't breaking ground," he said. "When do the cranes show up?"

The Baylight Redevelopment Authority has not released a construction mobilization timeline. Ramos's office did not respond to a Tribune request for comment before publication.

# OARI Names Three Pilot Districts. All Three Go to OPP Members. The Independent Who Provided the Deciding Vote Gets Nothing.

**Day 30 of 45**

**Tran crossed the aisle to give OARI its fifth vote. His district wasn't selected. Neither was Vega's. Every pilot goes to an OPP district.**

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Investigations

Three weeks ago, Dante Nelson wrote a letter to this paper from his building on 14th Street in Downtown. He works nights as a security guard. He had watched the council vote 5-4 to fund the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative and hoped the behavioral health teams would deploy in his neighborhood. He said he was hopeful, not celebrating. He said there was a difference.

He was right.

On Friday, Chief of Staff Laila Cortez transmitted a formal OARI implementation update to City Planning Director Mara Vance, signed on behalf of Mayor Avery Santana. The document named three pilot districts for the initiative's first deployment round: District 1, West Oakland, represented by Councilmember Denise Carter; District 5, Temescal, represented by Councilmember Janae Rivers; District 3, Fruitvale, represented by Councilmember Rose Delgado.

All three are Oakland People's Party members.

District 2 — Leonard Tran's district — did not make the list. Tran, an independent, provided the fifth and deciding vote on a 5-4 passage that would have failed without him. District 4, represented by Ramon Vega, who voted against the initiative, was also excluded.

The Tribune has not received a response from Councilmember Tran's office. Councilmember Vega's office has also not responded.

**The Question Nobody Asked Out Loud**

OARI passed the Oakland City Council in a 5-4 vote. The five YES votes: Carter, Tran, Delgado, Rivers, Mobley. The four NO votes: Vega, Crane, Ashford, Chen. Tran, an independent who broke from Vega to cross the aisle, provided the decisive fifth vote.

Three of those five YES-voting councilmembers will stand with Mayor Santana at the public announcement event. The Cortez document lists Carter, Rivers, and Delgado as attending district representatives. Tran's name does not appear. Mobley's name does not appear.

The Cortez document addresses Downtown directly — and addresses Dante Nelson by name.

"We are also aware that Dante Nelson, a security guard in Downtown, asked a reasonable question after the vote: what does this mean for my block?" The document continues: "The answer is: it means three districts get pilot deployment now, and the data from those pilots will determine whether and how the program expands to the rest of the city."

The selection rationale given in the document: crisis call volume per capita, existing community health infrastructure, council member cooperation, geographic distribution, and operational feasibility. On Downtown specifically: "The call volume data and community infrastructure assessment did not place it among the top three."

The document adds: "When the pilot data supports expansion, Downtown will be among the first districts evaluated for the next phase."

What that phrase means on a calendar — the document does not say.

**What the Three Pilots Actually Deploy**

Each selected district receives three two-person teams at initial deployment. One licensed behavioral health clinician — licensed clinical social worker, marriage and family therapist, or licensed psychologist — and one certified peer counselor with lived experience in recovery, homelessness, or substance use. Nine teams total at launch. Full deployment targets fifteen teams across the three districts, thirty personnel.

The 80-hour training curriculum, developed by the Department of Violence Prevention with Alameda County Behavioral Health, covers crisis de-escalation, field assessment protocols, OPD dispatch coordination, cultural competency, mandatory reporting, and scenario-based field exercises. Job postings are expected within one week of the public announcement. Application window: 21 days. Conditional offers projected approximately six weeks after posting.

Vehicle procurement is in process. Nine response vehicles. Projected delivery: four to six weeks from order confirmation. District 1 staging uses existing Department of Violence Prevention facilities in West Oakland. Districts 3 and 5 require new staging arrangements — the Planning Office has been formally asked to identify sites and negotiate leases.

A seven-member Community Advisory Board will be established within 30 days of the announcement. Nominations open at announcement. Monthly meetings during initial deployment; quarterly thereafter. The Cortez document is explicit: "The board is advisory. Operational decisions remain with the Department of Violence Prevention under the Mayor's authority."

**What the Clock Says**

The 45-day window for pilot district selection is now past its midpoint. The Mayor's office says it is "ahead of schedule." The pilot districts are selected. Hiring criteria exist. The advisory board design is written.

What does not yet exist: a single hired staff member. A single trained team. A single vehicle in service.

Theo Park, the Mayor's communications director and designated OARI press contact, has not responded to a Tribune request for the public announcement date.

Dante Nelson, reached Friday evening, said he had not received any direct communication from the city about the pilot selection. He said he had read about it the same way everyone else had — from documents and news accounts.

"I'm not surprised Downtown didn't get the first round," he said. "I'm watching what 'next phase' turns into. I've heard 'next phase' before in this city."

The votes are behind us. The paperwork is filed. What happens now is the part Oakland has never been patient enough to wait for — and never been wrong to be impatient about.

This week, two pieces of paper cleared the Baylight District for construction. The $2.1 billion project that the council debated for months is now, legally, ready to begin. Forty-seven families and small businesses learned they're getting Stabilization Fund checks. Three neighborhoods learned they'll be the first to see behavioral health teams instead of police on certain crisis calls.

These are not promises. These are commitments with money attached to them. That distinction matters in Oakland, where we have a long memory for the difference.

But commitments have a clock. Forty-seven people are approved — two hundred and ninety-five are still waiting. Three pilot districts are named — the rest of the city, including the councilmember who cast the deciding vote, was told to be patient. The Baylight instruments are filed — but nobody has released a construction calendar. And underneath it all, the infrastructure that every new project depends on is $60 million short of what it needs to maintain what already exists.

This is the edition where policy meets ground. Where the city finds out whether the machinery works as well as the speeches said it would. My reporters followed the documents this week — the primary sources, the signed instruments, the official responses that name Oakland residents by name in government letterhead. That's the kind of journalism a city needs when the talking stops and the building starts.

We're watching. The clocks are running.

# The Fund Is Disbursing. Forty-Seven People Get Checks. For the Rest, the Wait Continues.

**OEWD names Darius Clark in an official document. His application status remains undisclosed.**

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Ledger

The West Oakland Emergency Stabilization Fund opened for applications months ago. Three hundred and forty-two people submitted forms — more than double the number the city had projected. Then, for the better part of those months, the only official communication was silence.

On Friday, the Office of Economic and Workforce Development broke that silence with a status report to City Planning Director Mara Vance. The document, signed by Sandra Liu, Deputy Director for Community Investment, was explicit about what had gone wrong and specific about what comes next.

The first checks — forty-seven of them, totaling approximately $4.2 million — will go out within three weeks of the report's date.

Three hundred and forty-two people were waiting. Forty-seven have cleared review. The remaining two hundred and ninety-five are in some stage of denial, documentation hold, or unprocessed queue.

**The Accounting**

The OEWD report breaks the 342 applications into four categories. Forty-seven approved; first-round disbursement of approximately $4.2 million within three weeks. Thirty-one denied; those applicants will receive written explanations with instructions for appeal. One hundred and ten pending additional documentation — proof of residency, income verification, business registration, or landlord confirmation — with 14 days to return materials. One hundred and fifty-four not yet reviewed; OEWD targets completion of all initial reviews by the end of October 2041.

A second disbursement round is projected approximately six weeks after the first. Estimated at 50 to 70 additional approvals, with an estimated total between $5 million and $7 million. Third and subsequent rounds will occur monthly until the $28 million authorization is fully committed or all eligible applications are resolved.

The review criteria, which had not been publicly disclosed before Friday, are now on the record. Residential applicants must reside within designated West Oakland census tracts and earn at or below 80% of Area Median Income. Business applicants must operate in West Oakland with ten or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Award ranges: $5,000 to $25,000 for residential grants; $15,000 to $75,000 for small business grants. Maximum single award: $75,000.

Priority scoring applies to businesses facing rent increases exceeding 15% year-over-year, residential tenants who have received formal rent increase notices or eviction proceedings, and applicants with dependents under 18 or over 65.

**The Name in the Document**

Government status reports do not typically name individual residents. This one does.

"The Planning Office's status request noted that Darius Clark, a bakery worker in West Oakland, was handed an application form and told to wait," the OEWD document states. "That characterization is accurate and it is not acceptable as a final answer."

The document continues: "Mr. Clark's experience represents approximately 342 similar experiences. Every one of those applicants submitted a form based on a council commitment, and every one of them has been operating since then without information about whether or when that commitment would be honored. The delay has had real consequences for people making real decisions — about hiring, about leases, about whether to stay in a neighborhood that is changing around them."

Whether Darius Clark is among the 47 whose checks are arriving, the 31 who were denied, the 110 still waiting on documentation, or the 154 not yet reviewed — the OEWD document does not say. His name is there as an acknowledgment of institutional failure. His application status is not disclosed.

**The Explanation**

OEWD attributed the delay to two factors: volume and documentation gaps.

The fund was staffed for 150 to 200 applicants. It received 342. A three-person review team processed what it could until, in the fourth week, it became clear the pace was unsustainable. Two additional review staff were brought on. Those five staff members have been active for approximately three weeks and "have materially accelerated the review pace," the report states.

A secondary delay came from incomplete applications — about one in three required follow-up documentation. Applicants were notified by mail and given 14 days to respond.

The document does not offer these factors as justifications. "None of these factors constitute an acceptable reason for applicants to have heard nothing since submitting their forms," Liu writes. "This office should have issued a public status update when the volume exceeded projections and again when additional staff were onboarded. We did not. That is being corrected now."

Beverly Hayes, a West Oakland resident who said she submitted her application in the first week the fund was open, had not received notification about her status as of Friday afternoon. "I did everything right," she said. "I turned in every paper they asked for. Months of nothing, and then I'm reading a news article to find out what's happening." She said she would give it the three weeks OEWD cited before following up. "But if that clock runs out and I still haven't heard anything, I'm going down there in person."

# The $60 Million Hole Gets Two New Projects Poured On Top of It

**Two major developments clear legal hurdles. Both add demand to an infrastructure system already $60 million short.**

By Trevor Shimizu | Bay Tribune Infrastructure

August 12, 2041: Oakland City Council approves $2.1 billion in Baylight District financing. Three weeks later: the legal instruments clear. Construction mobilization authorized.

August 2041, concurrent: City Planning Director Mara Vance transmits a routine implementation status review to the Mayor's office. Buried in it, a figure that hasn't changed since last edition: Oakland's infrastructure maintenance budget stands at $140 million against an identified need of $200 million. The gap is $60 million. Nobody has announced a plan to close it.

Two major new developments just became legally authorized to proceed. Both of them add demand to the same infrastructure network that's already running $60 million behind.

This is not a paradox. It is how cities work — and how cities break.

**What the TIF Pays For, and What It Doesn't**

Ordinance BD-83-TIF, the Tax Increment Financing instrument filed Friday for the Baylight District, is a detailed document. Its authorized use list covers eight categories of infrastructure spending: environmental remediation, shoreline stabilization, water and sewer, utility installation, transit integration (the BART pedestrian bridge, ferry terminal expansion, AC Transit priority lanes), roadway improvements, stadium-adjacent public works and open space, and Redevelopment Authority administrative costs.

That list covers Baylight's own infrastructure. What it does not cover: maintenance of the existing system that Baylight's development will draw on. The water and sewer mains feeding the district. The signal systems on adjacent arterials that will absorb 12,000 to 15,000 additional vehicle trips on event days, per the Draft Environmental Impact Report's own estimates. The AC Transit lines running into the Fruitvale and Downtown stations that feed into the new ferry and BART connections.

The TIF is a funding mechanism for new construction. The baseline system underneath it runs on the city's general infrastructure budget — the one with the $60 million gap.

**Fruitvale Phase II Adds Another Layer**

Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II is at the developer RFP stage. The project: 420 units, $230 million, 67% affordable housing, on a site adjacent to the Fruitvale BART station. The design logic is transit-oriented — a 0.5 parking ratio, meaning 210 spaces for 420 units, betting that residents will use BART and AC Transit rather than cars.

That bet has a system behind it. The Fruitvale BART station handles commute loads every weekday with infrastructure built for a different era's ridership numbers, as the Tribune reported last edition. Phase II adds residential density to a station entrance that already operates at capacity during peak hours. The AC Transit buses feeding that station run on a network that has three documented mechanical failures in two months on its highest-ridership corridor.

Adding 420 units to a transit node is sound urban planning when the transit node can absorb the load. Whether Fruitvale's transit infrastructure — regional and local — can absorb the load that Phase II assumes is not a question the RFP addresses.

**What the Planning Office Said**

Mara Vance's directive to city departments explicitly flags the infrastructure gap and notes that both Baylight and Fruitvale Phase II will add demand pressure. The directive also notes that the Temescal Community Health Center — a $45 million project passed by the council — remains in design and permitting, with Vance having recommended a priority municipal project designation that could compress the permitting timeline. The Mayor's office has not responded to that recommendation.

Jose Wright, a 26-year-old electrician in Temescal, spent two weeks last month running conduit in a building where the sewer lateral had been condemned. "New buildings go up all the time," he said Thursday, standing outside a job site on Telegraph Avenue. "The question is what they're connecting to. Old pipes don't care how new the building is."

Shawn Nguyen, the Fruitvale construction laborer, put the Baylight version of the same question differently. "They filed the papers. Good. Now somebody needs to tell us what's going in first — the new BART bridge or the water main that's been failing since 2039."

The Redevelopment Authority's TIF ordinance specifies what gets paid for by increment revenue. The city's infrastructure maintenance budget specifies what doesn't. The distance between those two documents is $60 million.

**BUSINESS TICKER — EDITION 84**

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund's first checks are in motion. The Office of Economic and Workforce Development approved 47 applications and is issuing approximately $4.2 million in disbursements within three weeks, according to an official status response released this week. All 47 applicants will receive written confirmation by mail and phone before checks arrive — a procedural step the OEWD acknowledged should have been standard from the start.

The fund has received 342 applications since opening. Forty-seven approved. One hundred and ten pending additional documentation. One hundred and fifty-four unreviewed. The math is clear: 295 applicants remain in limbo. Darius Clark, the bakery worker in West Oakland I spoke with last month, was handed an application form and told to wait. He is still waiting. His situation is no longer unique — it is the modal experience. The OEWD's own response, released to the Planning Office, states plainly: "None of these factors constitute an acceptable reason for applicants to have heard nothing since submitting their forms." The fund was authorized in the spring. It is now late summer. Patience has a cost: for small operators making decisions about hiring, about lease renewals, about whether to stay in a neighborhood that is changing around them.

The Baylight development — $2.1 billion in waterfront bonds approved last cycle — cleared mobilization this week. That means the remediation work that clears the Jack London waterfront soil can now begin. Construction employment follows. But contract awards precede employment. The question embedded in every public infrastructure project is the same: who gets paid first? The TIF zone established for Baylight captures property tax increment for thirty years, with a 3 percent administrative cap. That mechanism services the bonds. The sequence of contract awards for remediation, infrastructure, and the first phase of construction will reshape labor access for Oakland trades. That story is weeks behind this one.

Jack London's nightlife corridor has been running at the highest activity of the year since late June. Jalen Hill, 35, a line cook I spoke with Friday, said his kitchen has been running covers at a pace he hasn't seen in two years — tickets piling up, weekend doubles stretching late into the night. That surge is real. It is also geographic. The question worth asking is whether the commercial energy in Jack London mirrors what's happening on 7th Street, in Fruitvale, along San Pablo — whether the city's recovery is distributed or concentrated.

# The Doors Were Already Open

**Faith institutions greet an OARI city announcement — and keep doing what they were doing before it**

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

The side door of St. Columba Catholic Church on Fruitvale Avenue was propped open with a brick Wednesday morning, the way it is most mornings when the parish hall is in use. Inside, folding tables were up, coffee was going, and a woman with a clipboard was asking people to sign in before they sat down. No banner. No announcement. Just open.

I've been past this church a hundred times. I grew up eight blocks from here. But I hadn't been inside in years, and something made me stop this week, because Fruitvale is one of three Oakland neighborhoods — along with West Oakland and Temescal — that the city announced as pilot districts for its new behavioral health response program. A new kind of city presence, arriving in these neighborhoods. Peer counselors instead of police for certain calls. A team trained to show up for the person in crisis, not just the situation.

It's a program a lot of people fought hard for. It passed the council 5-4, and the arguing over it was loud enough that it made the front page. What I found at St. Columba on Wednesday was quieter. It was people already doing something very close to the same work.

Rafael Phillips, 26, a server from Fruitvale I've spoken to before, was helping unload boxes in the parish hall — canned goods, mostly, the same work he does some Saturday mornings at the Cathedral of Christ the Light food pantry across town. "I go where I'm needed," he said. He didn't know the OARI districts had been announced. When I told him Fruitvale was one of them, he set down the box he was carrying and thought for a second. "That's good," he said finally. "I just hope they actually send people. Not just the announcement."

That's the thing about Fruitvale. The neighborhood has heard announcements before.

Andre Lee, 55, an electrician from Temescal who volunteers at St. Columba on his days off, was wiping down the long tables in the parish hall when I came in. He's been doing this for three years, he told me — driving across town to help because a friend from church asked him to and he said yes and never found a reason to stop. He'd heard about the OARI pilot districts too. "Temescal's on the list as well," he said. "I live there." He paused, folding the rag he was using. "I think it's a good idea. I just think people forget that the church has been the behavioral health response in a lot of neighborhoods for a long time. We just didn't call it that."

He wasn't saying it bitterly. He said it the way someone says a true thing they've had a while to think about.

The congregation at St. Columba has been running community support programming for as long as anyone there can remember. A seniors lunch that has served thousands of meals. A listening space for people going through hard times. Referrals to social services when they know what's available, and honest acknowledgment when they don't. None of it appears in a city budget. None of it would qualify as a behavioral health intervention under any official definition. But it is people showing up for other people, which is closer to the definition than it might sound.

This is what Oakland's faith institutions do. Not because the city asked them to, and not because there's money in it. Because they're there, the buildings are open, and the people who run them have decided that open means open.

The OARI pilot is real. The $12.5 million appropriated for it is real. The peer counselors who will be hired and trained are real. I don't want to undercut that — the program has the potential to change outcomes in neighborhoods that have too often been served by responses that weren't built for the situations they were being sent to handle.

But I keep thinking about the woman with the clipboard at St. Columba on Wednesday morning, asking people to sign in before they sat down. Not because anyone required it. Just so she knew who was there, and could follow up if someone needed something later.

That's not a program. That's a practice. And it's been running for years.

The city's new behavioral health teams will have radios and training and a dispatch system. St. Columba has a propped-open door and a brick on the ground to hold it. I'm not sure which one I trust more. I'm not sure I have to choose.

Calvin Turner, 38, a mechanic from Fruitvale, stopped to drop off a bag of groceries before his shift. He set it on the table, nodded at the woman with the clipboard, and left. He didn't give his name. He just came by. He told me later, when I caught him in the parking lot, that he comes by once a week. "My mom used to go here," he said. "It just feels like the right thing."

It was sixty-three degrees and clear on Wednesday. The kind of morning that tricks you into thinking everything is fine. Fruitvale Avenue hummed with the usual traffic. The door at St. Columba stayed open.

# While the Checks Are Still Coming

**Allen Temple's food pantry serves East Oakland on its own schedule — city money or not**

By Elliot Graye | Bay Tribune

EAST OAKLAND — The line outside Allen Temple Baptist Church on East 14th Street formed before seven o'clock Saturday morning, the way it does most Saturdays. By the time the doors to the food pantry opened, it had stretched past the church marquee and around the corner.

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund approved 47 disbursements this week, totaling $4.2 million, with checks expected to reach recipients within three weeks. That's good news for families who applied — and there were far more applicants than anyone anticipated. The fund, passed by the council six weeks ago, drew 342 applications from a program that had planned for 150.

East Oakland is not one of the fund's primary focus neighborhoods. But it is full of people who watched the fund pass, who know families in West Oakland who applied, and who are doing their own arithmetic about what it means when a city promises money and then makes you wait for it.

"My neighbor in West Oakland put in an application," said Bruce Wright, 48, a line cook from Downtown who was volunteering in the pantry line. He'd taken the morning off to help — someone from his church asked, and he said yes. "She's doing okay. But she's also been waiting. And in the meantime, you still need groceries."

This is not a criticism of the fund. It's the reality of how these programs work. The vote happens. The administration begins. The applications get reviewed. The checks get written. The money moves. And while all of that is happening, people still need to eat on Saturday.

Allen Temple Baptist Church understands this. The congregation has been running its food pantry for years — the operation predates the Stabilization Fund, predates the current council majority, predates most of the civic initiatives that will shape West Oakland's next decade. It runs because people need it to run, and people at Allen Temple decided to run it.

The church doesn't track political timelines. It tracks how much food it has and how many people are in line.

On Saturday morning, the line moved steadily. Volunteers in green vests directed people through a side entrance. Boxes of produce, packaged goods, and bread moved from hand to hand. By nine o'clock, the first wave had cleared.

Wright was still there by nine o'clock, stacking boxes with the same quiet consistency he'd had all morning. "I got called last week," he said. "Someone from my church asked if I could come help. So I came." He didn't have a longer explanation than that. It didn't require one.

Across town at the Cathedral of Christ the Light on Lake Merritt, the congregation observed the Feast of the Assumption Thursday evening — a traditional Catholic holy day, the calendar turning as it always does, regardless of what's happening at City Hall. The cathedral is also home to a weekly food pantry that has been running at elevated capacity for months, a pattern that shows no sign of slowing.

Jose Wright, 26, a Temescal electrician who volunteers at the Cathedral pantry some Saturday mornings, told me the pace has been consistent. "People keep coming," he said. "Doesn't matter what the news says. Doesn't change on Saturdays."

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund will eventually put money in people's hands. The $4.2 million that was approved this week is real. It will reach real families. Three weeks is not a very long time in the life of a city initiative. But it is three more Saturdays.

Allen Temple's doors will be open for each of them.

# What the Waterfront Sounds Like Now

**Before the Baylight crews arrive, Jack London holds its own kind of late summer night**

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

The last Friday before the equipment arrives is still just a Friday. That's what Marcus Walker, 48, a dishwasher at a restaurant on the Jack London waterfront, told me when I ran into him outside the loading dock around nine o'clock last week, the bay air still warm at 63 degrees.

"I heard they're starting soon," he said. He meant the Baylight remediation — soil excavation, groundwater treatment, the physical beginning of the project that the council voted through last month. The two bonding instruments are finalized. The environmental work can begin. "My manager said there's gonna be noise." He shrugged. "There's already noise."

He went back inside. The kitchen hummed. The bay sat there, as it always has, dark and unhurried.

The Baylight District, when it is built, will be a 35,000-seat open-air stadium on this waterfront, surrounded by mixed-use development and 3,200 residential units, a project valued at $2.1 billion that passed by six votes to three and will reshape this end of Oakland over the next several years. That is what is coming. What is here right now, on a late summer Friday in the corridor between Jack London Square and the water, is restaurants and bars and the usual crowd of people who have been using this stretch of Oakland for years, the way people use a place they like before they're told they have to start being careful of it.

Jalen Hill, 35, a line cook who's worked in Jack London for five years, was smoking outside between his prep and service shifts. "I'm staying," he said, when I asked if he was worried. "I've been here through a lot. I'll be here through this." He thought about it. "Probably more people coming, eventually. Maybe that's good for business. Maybe it changes what kind of business is here." He flicked ash. "Ask me in five years."

Muralist Dante Reyes was across the street, looking at a warehouse wall near the rail yards where he's painted before — not working, just looking. He grew up in Jack London, back when it wasn't called that officially, when it was just where the warehouses were. "I always thought this waterfront was going to get built eventually," he said. He didn't sound alarmed. He sounded like someone who has been watching something approach for a long time and has made their peace with the fact that it was going to get here. "My work will still be here. Some of it. The rest will be whatever it is."

He is one of several artists who have used the warehouse walls along this corridor for the last decade — murals, tags, large-scale work that will not survive the construction. He knows this. He did not seem in a hurry to have me feel sorry about it. "The walls were always borrowed," he said.

Oakland is not a city that does uncomplicated grief about its own change. It has done this too many times — the port expansion, the Coliseum fights, the years of empty promises about development that never came, the years of development that came and took things with it. What Jalen Hill said about asking him in five years is the most honest thing I heard all week, and it was said while he was on a smoke break between prep and service.

Up the waterfront, in Uptown, Jade Orion was playing a small venue — not a headliner slot, just a night show on a weeknight, the kind of thing she's done dozens of times. The room was half-full by nine-thirty, the speakers warm, the kind of crowd that came because they knew to come. The music was good. I stood near the back for twenty minutes and thought about Dante Reyes looking at his wall and Marcus Walker going back through the loading dock and Jalen Hill with five more years to wait.

This is what the waterfront sounds like now. Before the first equipment arrives. While it's still just Friday.

# Two Hundred and Twenty-Five Million Dollars

**I want to believe in Eric Taveras. I'm trying. Here's where it gets complicated.**

By P Slayer | Bay Tribune Sports [OPINION]

My uncle used to say: "Don't tell me what it cost. Tell me what it does."

He was talking about a transmission. He was talking about every single thing he ever bought for the rest of his life. And this winter, standing at the kitchen counter watching the Taveras news roll in at whatever hour the front office decided to announce a $225 million commitment, I heard his voice as clearly as I have ever heard it.

Two hundred and twenty-five million dollars. Eric Taveras. Second base. Age twenty-five. Career batting average: .244.

I want to be honest with you. I want to be the kind of writer who looks at .244 and says "career average doesn't tell the whole story" and then walks you through launch angles and expected slugging and explains why the front office is playing three-dimensional chess while the rest of us are playing checkers. I have friends who would do that. I've read the pieces. Some of them are even right.

But I'm not built that way. I'm built to sit in the upper deck on a Tuesday night in April with people who work for a living and watch Eric Taveras take a called third strike with a runner on second, and when the person next to me says "two hundred and twenty-five million dollars," I need to have an answer.

Here is my answer. Here is the whole thing, laid out.

The case for Taveras: He is twenty-five. He has never played in a lineup like this one — Danny Horn in center, Darrin Davis in left, Mark Aitken at first, a bullpen that now features Mariano Rosales coming out of the back end with thirty-eight saves on his career resume. The protection in this lineup is real. The pressure on any individual hitter to manufacture runs is lower than it has been in years. If Taveras is the .244 hitter he has always been but now hits in the middle of a lineup this deep, the damage he does — the doubles, the sac flies, the walks he draws because pitchers would rather pitch to him than pitch to Horn — becomes genuinely meaningful. There is a version of this that works.

Here is the counter-argument to my counter-argument, which I think deserves its own paragraph: Cy Newell is gone. The right-hander we traded to Washington to get Travis Coles is gone. Two other pieces went with him. We paid the price for Coles and then we paid again for Taveras and those are two very different kinds of payments. The Coles payment I understand — a 2.05 ERA speaks for itself, and a twenty-two-year-old starter with that profile is worth the departure cost if you're building for October. Rosales at the back of the bullpen with thirty-eight saves from Baltimore makes sense. The roster architecture, taken piece by piece, has a logic.

What keeps me up is the overall math. We spent down in one direction to spend up in another. We moved Darrin Davis to left field — a two-time MVP who did not have to do that, who agreed to it because he is the kind of player Oakland deserves and so rarely gets — specifically so that a twenty-four-year-old rookie named Quintero could hit. And then we also committed to Taveras at $225 million. Those two commitments, taken together, ask this question: What exactly is the plan when both of them are in the lineup on the same night and neither of them is hitting?

Deacon Seymour has to manage that. A first-year manager inheriting a roster with three legends in farewell seasons, four new acquisitions, and a price tag that will echo in the back pages for years if it goes wrong. I don't envy him. I admire him, actually — the man addressed the strength coach situation directly, without hedging, and that is the kind of managerial character that Oakland has been waiting for. But character doesn't hit curveballs.

Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go to Mesa. I'm going to watch Eric Taveras take batting practice in the desert sun. I am going to watch him work the count and track the ball out of the pitcher's hand and I am going to try to see what the front office saw when they made this commitment.

And I'm going to remember what my uncle said about the transmission.

Tell me what it does. Not what it cost. What it does.

Because $225 million is not a bet on who Taveras has been. It is a bet on who he is going to become. And that is either the most Oakland thing this front office has ever done — believe in something before the city gets to see it — or it is the most expensive mistake in recent franchise history.

We will know by October.

# The Man in the Red Jacket

**Mike Paulson came back to Oakland wearing Bulls colors. The city gave him a standing ovation anyway. I'm still thinking about why.**

By P Slayer | Bay Tribune Sports [OPINION]

Last week at Chase Center, they announced Mike Paulson's name over the PA and the place stood up.

He was sitting courtside. Bulls red and black. First-year GM of the team that had just beaten the Warriors a hundred and twenty-one to a hundred and five, the team that Steph Curry had just given twenty-five points to and still lost with. Mike Paulson, the man who left Oakland for Chicago and came back wearing the other team's colors, and when they put his face on the screen and said his name into the arena, Oakland stood up.

Benji Dillon was next to him. Mark Aitken was on his left. Vinnie Keane was down the row. The three men who built the A's dynasty sat courtside with the man who used to run the organization that the dynasty was built for, and all four of them got standing ovations, and the Warriors lost the game anyway.

I've been sitting with that image for a week now. I keep turning it over.

Here is what it means, and here is what it doesn't mean.

What it means: Oakland has a long memory for people who showed up. Paulson showed up. He came back to Mesa for spring training. He took the heat when the walkout deserved heat. He apologized, in person, in a room in Oakland, the way you have to apologize if you want Oakland to actually hear it. Whatever he is now — Bulls GM, man in a red jacket, the answer to the question the Warriors still haven't officially asked — he was ours first. Oakland doesn't give that back. Not completely. The standing ovation at Chase Center was Oakland saying: we remember the whole story, not just the chapter that hurt.

But I need to be honest about the other thing.

That man came to Oakland last week in the colors of the team that beat the Warriors. The Warriors, who are now thirty-nine and twenty-eight with a two-game winning streak and Giannis Antetokounmpo and Steph Curry together in the same backcourt, and who are still sitting just far enough outside the true playoff picture that every home loss feels like a step backward. The Warriors have been linked to Paulson's name for months now. The rumor hasn't gone anywhere because it doesn't need to go anywhere — it just sits there, and the Warriors keep not commenting, and Paulson keeps not commenting, and every time Paulson shows up in the Bay Area in a public place it becomes a story.

The standing ovation was real. The affection is real. But the situation is not resolved.

Paulson is good at his job. What he did in Chicago — including locking in Ayo Dosunmu at depth pricing and building a team that's at the top of the East — is not the work of a man who stumbled into a GM chair. He is a first-year GM with the results of a third-year GM. The Bulls won in Oakland last week. The Warriors are now thirty-nine and twenty-eight and playing their best basketball of the late season, which is good, and they are doing it without resolving the Paulson question, which is complicated.

Dillon. Aitken. Keane. All three of them courtside for it. All three of them in the final spring of their careers, about to go to Mesa and do the work that endings require, and last week they sat next to a man who left and came back wearing different colors and they gave him a night out. That is Oakland too. That is the specific Oakland generosity that I wrote about after the walkout and that I still believe in.

I just don't know what it costs us when it's over.

# One More Spring

**Three legends. One last season. The dynasty that built Oakland baseball is saying goodbye on the field where it started.**

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports

I was in the press box at the Coliseum in 2031 when Vinnie Keane hit the home run that ended it. Nobody sat down for nine minutes. I timed it on my stopwatch out of habit, then put the watch back in my pocket and just stood there the way everyone else stood there, because you cannot narrate the moment you are still inside of.

Forty-four years covering Oakland baseball. You learn to recognize endings. You learn the sound of them — the particular quality of silence that settles over a crowd that has just watched something it will spend the rest of its life trying to describe.

I heard that sound again this week at the A's spring facility in Mesa. It was softer this time. It didn't come from a crowd at all. It came from a ballpark at half-capacity in the February sun, and it came at the exact moment that Isley Kelley stepped into the left-hand batter's box for his first spring training at-bat of what everyone in Oakland already knows will be his final season.

He went two-for-three. Hit a double off a Padres arm in the second inning. The ball split the gap in left-center, and Kelley rounded first and pulled into second with the kind of unhurried efficiency that has defined him for fourteen years — mechanical, precise, unavoidable. The modest Mesa crowd gave him a genuine ovation. Three rows of season-ticket holders who had driven down from Phoenix, scouts in polo shirts with clipboards, a group of kids in matching travel-ball jerseys who probably couldn't tell you what the 2031 World Series meant, but who recognized something in the noise around them and decided it warranted standing.

That is what legacy does. It teaches people to stand without being told why.

You will hear a version of this story told as tragedy: the dynasty is ending, the giants are leaving, what comes after cannot possibly be what came before. I have written that story myself. I have been writing versions of it since Kelley first started mentioning a distant future in passing interviews, since Dillon's velocity began its honest conversation with the calendar, since Keane's bench role last season stopped being a choice and started being what remained.

But I want to suggest a different frame, because forty-four years teaches you that the frame is the thing.

What is happening in Mesa right now is not a funeral. It is a graduation.

Isley Kelley is leaving with 92.1 career WAR, three MVP awards, 447 home runs, and 2,398 hits. He is, by every statistical measure ever devised for this purpose, an inner-circle Hall of Famer — the kind of player who, in fifty years, someone will pull up as evidence in an argument about the greatest shortstops who ever lived. He is not leaving because he failed. He is leaving because he finished.

Benji Dillon is leaving with five Cy Young Awards and two hundred wins. He won those Cy Youngs the left-handed way — not with overpowering velocity but with a command that could make a ninety-three-mile-per-hour fastball look like a magic trick when it arrived at the exact corner he intended, every time. The arm is borrowed time now, yes — Dillon himself said that in a Sports Illustrated piece a couple of seasons ago. But borrowed time from whom? He gave everything that arm had. Whatever is left belongs to him.

Vinnie Keane will not start most days. He is 436 home runs and six World Series rings in a bench role, wearing the same number he wore when Oakland fell in love with him. His body has negotiated terms with the years and the terms are what they are. What has not negotiated is the presence — the particular gravity of a man who has been the heartbeat of this franchise for long enough that the franchise has shaped itself around his rhythm.

Three players. One last spring. All of them facing the same direction.

And behind them, arriving in Mesa for the first time in green and gold: Travis Coles, age twenty-two, with a 2.05 ERA from his time in Washington. Ernesto Quintero, twenty-four years old, stepping into the designated hitter role that Darrin Davis vacated so gracefully last season. Mariano Rosales at the back of the bullpen with thirty-eight saves from Baltimore on his resume and a closer's urgency in his eyes. Eric Taveras at second base with a $225 million reason to prove he belongs here.

This is the thing about dynasties that the elegies always miss. They do not end. They transform. The players who built them teach something — about patience, about commitment, about what it looks like to stay in Oakland when Oakland is hard — and that teaching becomes part of the franchise's culture whether or not anyone can point to where it came from.

Deacon Seymour managed his first game Tuesday with a lineup that included Kelley at shortstop and three first-year players in the lineup card. He is not managing a farewell tour. He is managing both things simultaneously: the end of one era and the beginning of another, in a spring training game in Mesa in February, with the desert light falling the same way it always falls and the grass as green as it has ever been.

I have been coming to this press box for forty-four years. I have watched Oakland teams arrive in spring training young and hopeful and leave in October with trophies or heartbreak, and I have watched them arrive old and finish young in ways no one predicted. I have learned that spring training tells you almost everything you need to know about a team and almost nothing you need to know about a season.

What it tells you this year is this: the three men who built this dynasty are still here. They showed up. They are earning the ending that their careers deserve.

Go watch them while you can. You will not see this particular combination again.

# Mesa, Tuesday: The First Data Point

**A's 4, Padres 1. What the opener tells us — and what it doesn't — about Seymour's roster puzzle.**

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

The box score from Tuesday's spring opener in Mesa tells you almost nothing about what this Oakland team will be in October, and Deacon Seymour would be the first to say so. Spring training results are noise. Seymour said as much to the beat reporters assembled behind the cage during Tuesday morning's batting practice — not as a deflection, but as a matter of genuine philosophy about how information works. "I'll tell you what I'm watching," he said. "I'm watching how they talk to each other."

The A's beat the Padres four to one. That is the first piece of data from a season that will generate somewhere north of thirty thousand data points before October forces anyone to draw conclusions. But data points have context, and the context here is worth examining.

Isley Kelley went two-for-three with a double, which is exactly the kind of production an inner-circle Hall of Fame shortstop with career numbers like Kelley's ought to produce against February pitching. The more interesting Kelley data was in his movement — how quickly he got to his first double off the bat, the range on a play in the hole in the third inning that he made look routine. At thirty-seven years old in his final season, Kelley's bat is not the primary concern. His body's conversation with the calendar is. What Tuesday suggested, cautiously, is that the conversation is going acceptably.

Martin Richards also went two-for-three with a double. Richards posted six-point-eight WAR last season with a fielding percentage that had Elliot Marbury running comparisons through every third-base leaderboard he could access. He is in a contract year, headed to free agency after 2042, and he has either never quite understood that the Tribune spent two seasons barely noticing him or he has understood it completely and chosen not to care. Either interpretation fits what you see when you watch him work: a professional conducting his profession without waiting for anyone's approval. The double Tuesday was clean — an opposite-field shot that fell in front of a diving outfielder. Richards was already rounding second before the center fielder straightened up.

Henry Rivas started and logged three innings, four strikeouts, and one earned run. Three innings is not a meaningful spring sample. What it is, for a rotation that now has Travis Coles at the front end and Benji Dillon somewhere in the middle of his last season, is a useful reminder that the depth behind the top of this staff is real. Rivas has never been flashy. He has also never been unreliable.

The roster questions that Tuesday didn't answer are the same ones that will run through Mesa for the next month. Darrin Davis, the two-time MVP, has agreed to play left field this season — a defensive position that requires a different physical vocabulary than the designated hitter role he has occupied for most of his career. Davis's range and read-and-react metrics in the outfield will be an ongoing conversation all spring. Tuesday told us nothing about that because Davis did not appear in Tuesday's game. He is on a measured schedule as his ACL recovery from last season enters its final phase. He will be ready for Opening Day. Whether the left field will be ready for him is the question no one can answer from the press box in Mesa in February.

Eric Taveras did not start Tuesday, either. The $225 million second baseman is working through a deliberate spring program at Seymour's direction — not because anything is wrong, but because Seymour has been consistent about not letting contract size determine lineup construction. "Everyone earns their position," Seymour said on Monday. "That includes players we've made a significant investment in. Probably more so." Taveras took twenty-five minutes of extra ground balls after the main session ended Tuesday afternoon. His hands were clean. The mechanics looked right. Spring training.

Ernesto Quintero, the twenty-four-year-old who was promoted from Triple-A to occupy the designated hitter slot that Davis vacated, went hitless in two at-bats Tuesday. He also worked a full count on a veteran Padres left-hander in the fifth inning before grounding out — a plate appearance that, by itself, demonstrated the kind of discipline that distinguishes prospects from rookies who are not long for major league rosters. Quintero has power. The swing is quick to the ball. The question of how his bat adjusts to major-league breaking balls in a meaningful sample is the question no one knows the answer to, which is why it is still spring.

Mariano Rosales worked one inning in the seventh. His velocity was where it should be. Three batters, one strikeout, one groundout, one flyout. Rosales came to Oakland from Baltimore with thirty-eight saves in his career resume. He arrived not making it anyone's business whether he cared about that number or not, which is exactly the correct posture for a closer in spring training.

What Seymour is building — one Tuesday in February at a time — is not just a roster. It is a culture of operation. The legacy players who are here for their final seasons give the clubhouse a quality you cannot manufacture: the particular attention of men who know they are watching their last spring the way every other spring should have been watched. The new acquisitions arrive with either the pressure of their contracts or the hunger of their youth. Seymour's job is to keep both operating at the same temperature.

Tuesday, the A's beat the Padres four to one. It was the first data point. There are thirty thousand more coming.

# The Architect Goes Home

**At 46-20, the Bulls own the East — and the question of whether Mike Paulson stays to see it through just got a lot harder to avoid**

By Selena Grant | Skyline Tribune Chicago Bureau

Let's be precise about what happened this week: Mike Paulson flew to the Bay Area, sat in the visiting GM's box at Chase Center, and watched his Chicago Bulls beat the Golden State Warriors 121-105 on the road. Then he flew back. Two days later, his team beat the Lakers 117-103 at home. The Bulls are 46-20. The best record in the Eastern Conference. And Paulson still hasn't said a word about Golden State's reported pursuit of him.

The silence is becoming its own story.

The basketball itself has been loud enough. Josh Giddey, whom the league's All-Star selectors decided in February was not worth including on the roster, put together what may have been the most complete game of his career against Golden State: 25 points, 4 rebounds, and 20 assists against one turnover. Twenty assists. That is not a misprint. For context, only four players in NBA history have recorded 20 assists in a road game against a playoff-caliber opponent without turning the ball over. Whatever the All-Star snub clarified for Giddey, it is still working. The Lakers game added 19 points and 10 assists. He is not slumping. He is not cooling off. He is building something.

Hank Trepagnier, whose Rookie of the Year case was already the most underappreciated argument in professional basketball, went for 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 steals in the Golden State win. The steal numbers matter more than people are giving them credit for: Trepagnier is not just scoring his way into the ROY conversation — he's defending at a level that changes possessions. That combination, at his age, in a road environment with playoff implications, is the kind of thing that gets remembered.

Kevin Huerter made three threes in the Chase Center win. Worth noting because Huerter signed his new deal — three years, $16.88 million, below what his market value justified — two weeks ago. He had every reason to play distracted or bitter. Instead he looked like a man who decided where he was going and made his peace with it. "I want to be here when it counts," he told the Tribune earlier this month. The Chase Center win was when it counted. He showed up.

Walker Kessler added 14 points and 15 rebounds against Golden State. Adash Stanley has been consistent on both ends: 16 points and 4 assists in the Warriors game, then a team-high 27 points and 6 assists against the Lakers. Stanley is the quiet fulcrum of this team — not the headline, never the headline, but the player who makes Giddey's passing lanes functional and Trepagnier's cuts dangerous.

All of this is the backdrop to the question that Paulson's front office doesn't want to answer and hasn't been asked to answer publicly, but which is now embedded in every conversation about this team's ceiling: is he staying?

A person familiar with the situation, speaking without authorization to discuss internal matters, described the Warriors' interest as "serious and ongoing" as of this week. Paulson's camp has not responded to requests for comment. The Bulls' organization has declined to characterize the conversations as anything beyond rumor.

What makes this moment different from three weeks ago is what happened in Oakland on Tuesday: the Baylight District construction received final environmental clearance, formally unlocking the $2.1 billion development project that will reshape the city's waterfront. Paulson left Oakland for Chicago. Oakland just started building the thing that will define its next twenty years. The man who could have been there to run the team in that stadium is 1,900 miles away at 46-20, wondering — one assumes — if that's what home looks like from a distance.

The Bulls have fifteen games left in the regular season. Playoff seeding in the East is not settled. There is real work to do. Paulson, by all accounts, is doing it. But the architecture of this moment — a first-year GM, the best record in the conference, the team that wants him, the city that's starting to build — is too specific to ignore.

The Bulls are built to win. The question is whether the person who built them will be there to see it.

CHICAGO GROUND

# What 46-20 Feels Like on a Bridgeport Barstool

**At Calhoun's Tap on 31st, the neighborhood that claims Mike Paulson is running the numbers on what it might mean to lose him**

By Talia Finch | Skyline Tribune Chicago Bureau

The Blackhawks highlight reel on the TV above the bar had been wrong for six minutes before anyone noticed. The Bulls won last night. You'd think the place would know.

Calhoun's Tap on 31st Street has been open since 1987 and smells like every year of it — old wood, draft beer, the faint ghost of cigarette smoke from a decade before the ban. Tuesday afternoon, just after lunch, three people sat at the bar. One of them, a woman named Paulette Okafor, 47, a postal worker from Bridgeport, had her phone face-up on the bar with the box score still open. Bulls 117, Lakers 103. 46-20.

"My kid asked me this morning if Paulson's leaving," she said, not to me specifically, not to anyone in particular. "She's eleven. She's already thinking about it."

That's Bridgeport for you. The neighborhood that produced Paulson — grew up here, played high school ball at De La Salle, family still has a house three blocks from where we're sitting — does not experience his success with uncomplicated pride. It experiences it with the low-grade anxiety of people who have watched good things walk out of this city before and know what that looks like in the rearview.

Nobody in Calhoun's was willing to say it plainly, so I'll say it for them: 46-20 is great. Forty-six and twenty is the best record in the East and a first-year GM and Hank Trepagnier being the best rookie in the league, probably, and Josh Giddey having the kind of season that gets a statue eventually. That's all true. And Oakland just broke ground on the Baylight District — the $2.1 billion waterfront project — and somewhere in that news cycle, Bridgeport did the math on what a cleared construction site in California means for a man who used to live there.

Raymond Polk, 58, a retired school custodian from Bridgeport, set down his glass. He's been coming to Calhoun's since before the Bulls' last championship run. He's seen things. "You know what the bad part is?" he said. "They're going to offer him something we can't match. Not money. Something else." He paused. "He built Oakland for twenty years. He left. We don't know why. We don't ask. But that's a man who leaves."

He wasn't being cruel about it. He was being Bridgeport about it — the neighborhood that loves you and notices everything.

Paulette looked up from her phone. The Blackhawks reel was still going. "I told my daughter: the Bulls are good right now. Watch them be good right now. Don't worry about next year."

That pause — the one between "right now" and "don't worry about next year" — is the entire emotional weather of Chicago basketball in late February. The city knows how to enjoy a contender. It's just never quite figured out how to enjoy one without one eye on the door.

Outside on 31st, a city bus went by with a Bulls promotion on the side panel — Trepagnier, midair, arms wide. The bus didn't slow down.

— CULTURE: **Faith Domain Running Hot Across Oakland** — Twenty-three faith-related events logged citywide this edition. St. Columba, Allen Temple, and Cathedral of Christ the Light all running at elevated community capacity. When the city is between policy and delivery, the churches fill the gap.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

Dear Editor,

I manage the night shift at a parking garage on Broadway. Three times this month I've had to call 911 for someone in crisis on my floor — not threatening anyone, just lost. Shouting at nothing. Sitting in a stairwell shaking. The officers who show up are fine. They do what they can. But they're not trained for that and everyone involved knows it.

The OARI pilot goes to West Oakland, Temescal, Fruitvale. I read the selection criteria — call volume, existing infrastructure, council cooperation. Fine. But Downtown has call volume too. My garage alone generates calls. The building next door generates calls. I've talked to other night workers on this block and they all say the same thing: we're calling for help that doesn't exist yet.

I'm not complaining about who got picked first. I'm asking what the timeline looks like for the rest of us. The Mayor's document said Downtown would be "among the first districts evaluated for the next phase." I'd like to know what that means on a calendar. Because the next phase doesn't help the person in my stairwell tonight.

— Gloria Meeks, 57, Downtown

Dear Editor,

OEWD says my wait for Stabilization Fund approval was "not acceptable." Great. I appreciate the acknowledgment. But an unacceptable wait is still a wait. I filled out the form in person. They told me three weeks. Three weeks became six. Six became more. I checked status online. Nothing. Went back to the office. Different person, same answer — just wait.

Last week I heard 47 people got approved. $4.2 million going out. Checks in three weeks. I don't know if I'm in the 47 or if I'm in the rest. I've called four times. I've emailed. I'm running my shift at the bakery on fumes and credit cards because I thought this was coming. So the OEWD statement is nice. I'm glad they think my experience was unacceptable. I think so too. But what I actually need is for someone to tell me if I got approved or if I'm still waiting. Words are free. Money's not.

— Darius Clark, West Oakland

Dear Editor,

Baylight cleared for construction. I read the announcement. The bonds passed. The instruments are finalized. Shovels in the ground soon. I live three blocks away and I've walked past that empty lot probably two thousand times wondering if it would actually happen or just sit there forever like everything else in this city.

I'm not against the project. I read the DEIR. I have concerns about traffic and what happens when the sea rises — and it will rise. But I also know we need housing and we can't keep sitting on empty land and wondering about what-ifs. The council passed it. The environmental work happened. Now we actually build.

I've lived in Downtown long enough to be skeptical of "big announcements." But I've also learned that nothing happens unless someone actually commits to it. This is the commitment. I hope they do it right. I hope they're listening to the traffic concerns. I hope they're serious about the sea level piece. And I hope that in five years I'm walking past a building full of people instead of an empty lot. We'll see.

— Elena Reyes, 52, Downtown

Dear Editor,

I was at work when the video dropped of Mike Paulson walking into Chase Center in a Bulls jersey. My entire Slack went insane. I grew up watching that man play for Oakland. Not basketball, baseball. The A's. But he's everywhere in this city — he's the kind of person you root for just because he's ours.

Watching him sit courtside in red and black while the Warriors played the Bulls was wild. That standing ovation when they announced him hurt good, if that makes sense. Like it hurts because he's not green anymore but you're clapping anyway because he shows up. Mark Aitken was there. Benji Dillon. Vinnie Keane. Half of Oakland sports sitting in the same row. And he's in enemy colors.

But here's the thing — he came back. He came back to watch the game. He came back to walk through the building. He didn't hide in Chicago. He showed up and let the city say goodbye or hello or whatever we needed to say. That's harder than staying away. That's loyalty to the place even when you belong somewhere else now.

— Vincent Okoye, 28, Lake Merritt

COMING NEXT CYCLE
############################################################

— **OARI job postings expected.** The 45-day window is past its midpoint. If the Mayor's office is ahead of schedule as claimed, hiring should begin. The Tribune is watching for the first posting date and whether Downtown makes the second-round evaluation.

— **Stabilization Fund checks arrive.** Forty-seven people are expecting money within three weeks. The Tribune will follow up with Beverly Hayes and Darius Clark. If the clock runs out without checks in hand, that's a story.

— **Baylight construction calendar still missing.** The instruments are filed. The legal preconditions are satisfied. Keisha Ramos's office owes Oakland a timeline. We'll be asking.

— **Fruitvale Phase II heads to council.** The $230 million, 420-unit transit-oriented development is expected before the council this fall. The infrastructure questions Trevor Shimizu raised this edition will only get louder.

— **A's spring training continues.** Davis returns to the lineup. Taveras gets his first starts. Seymour's roster puzzle takes shape. Hal Richmond and Anthony will be in Mesa.
