### “Vucevic and DeRozan Gone: Paulson Clears the Deck in 48 Hours”

**United Center — Chicago, IL**

The locker room is quiet. Not the quiet of focus. The quiet of absence.

Nikola Vucevic’s stall: empty. DeMar DeRozan’s corner: cleared out. Two franchise anchors, gone before the trade deadline even approached.

Mike Paulson didn’t wait.

**The Deals (Details Unconfirmed):**

- **Nikola Vucevic** → Sacramento Kings
- **DeMar DeRozan** → Memphis Grizzlies

**Bulls receive:**

- 2026 Sacramento Kings 1st Round Pick (unprotected)
- 2026 Memphis 1st Round Pick (unprotected, unclear which — Memphis holds multiple 2026 firsts)

Full trade details expected in Cycle 44. What we know now: Chicago just shed approximately $55-60M in combined salary and acquired two lottery-range picks in what projects as a loaded 2026 draft class.

**The Math:**

With these moves, Paulson has positioned the Bulls for:

- 3 first-round picks in 2026 (own + Sacramento + Memphis)
- Nearly $80M in projected cap space
- The youngest roster in the Eastern Conference

This is not a retool. This is a demolition.

**The Vucevic Context:**

Sources close to the team confirmed tension between Vucevic and the front office dating to before Paulson’s official appointment. An unnamed source reported Vucevic making “disparaging comments” about Paulson’s potential hiring — comments the center publicly denied but never fully walked back.

Whether that friction accelerated his departure or was incidental to basketball decisions remains unclear. What’s clear: Vucevic is no longer Paulson’s problem.

**Locker Room Temperature:**

I spoke with three players on condition of anonymity. The consensus:

“We knew something was coming. You don’t hire a guy who built what he built in Oakland to run it back with the same roster. But two trades in two days? That’s fast. That’s a message.”

The message: This is Paulson’s team now. Everyone else is auditioning.

**What’s Next:**

With Vucevic and DeRozan gone, the Bulls’ remaining core consists of:

- Coby White (26, under contract through 2027)
- Patrick Williams (23, extension-eligible)
- Young prospects and expiring contracts

Paulson has cap space, draft capital, and time. The question is whether Chicago fans have patience.

Full trade breakdowns coming Cycle 44.

**Names Index:** Nikola Vucevic (Center, traded to Sacramento); DeMar DeRozan (Forward, traded to Memphis); Mike Paulson (General Manager); Coby White (Guard); Patrick Williams (Forward)

## MARCELLO REYES — NBA Investigation / National

### “The Oakland Playbook Comes to Chicago: What Paulson’s First Moves Tell Us”

**National Analysis**

In Oakland, Mike Paulson built a dynasty through three pillars: cost-controlled talent acquisition, analytical roster construction, and ruthless asset management. Six World Series titles in fifteen years. A farm system that never stopped producing.

Forty-eight hours into his Bulls tenure, we’re seeing the blueprint translate.

**The Parallel:**

When Paulson took over the A’s in 2025, he inherited a bloated payroll and an aging core. His first moves: trade veterans for prospects, shed salary, stockpile draft capital. The pain lasted two seasons. The dynasty lasted a decade.

Chicago just watched the same opening sequence.

Vucevic and DeRozan were productive players on a bad team. In Paulson’s calculus, productive players on bad teams are the most dangerous assets — good enough to win meaningless games, not good enough to contend, and expensive enough to prevent flexibility.

He removed them immediately.

**The Cross-Sport Question:**

Basketball isn’t baseball. The draft is less predictable. Star acquisition happens through free agency and trades, not farm systems. A single transcendent player can flip a franchise overnight in ways that don’t exist in MLB.

Paulson knows this. His cap space strategy suggests he’s planning for the 2026 free agent class as much as the draft. The $80M in projected room isn’t an accident — it’s a war chest.

**The Dual-Role Concern:**

Paulson remains Oakland’s GM. He’s now also Chicago’s GM. Two franchises, two sports, two time zones.

League sources express private skepticism. One Eastern Conference executive, speaking anonymously:

“You can’t be in two places at once. Either Oakland suffers, Chicago suffers, or both do. The man’s brilliant, but he’s not magic.”

Paulson’s response, through a spokesperson: “I’ve built systems that don’t require my presence to function. Oakland runs. Chicago will learn to run the same way.”

That’s the theory. We’ll see if it holds.

**Names Index:** Mike Paulson (General Manager, Bulls / Athletics); Nikola Vucevic (Center, traded to Sacramento); DeMar DeRozan (Forward, traded to Memphis)

### “The Oakland Guy Just Blew It Up: What Chicago’s Saying Tonight”

**From the Floor of Benchmark Bar, West Loop**

The trade notifications hit during the third quarter of the Bucks game. Nobody was watching the Bucks game after that.

I counted seventeen phones lighting up within thirty seconds. Then the arguments started.

**The Optimists:**

“Finally. Someone with a plan. We’ve been mediocre for years. Paulson’s the first guy who looked at this roster and said ‘this isn’t good enough’ out loud.” — Marcus, 34, insurance broker, been a Bulls fan since the Rose years.

“Three first-rounders in 2026? Do you know how loaded that draft class is supposed to be? We’re about to be the Thunder.” — DeShawn, 28, graphic designer, already running mock drafts on his phone.

**The Skeptics:**

“This dude is literally still running a baseball team in California. When’s he gonna be here? When’s he gonna watch games? He traded Vooch and DeMar from his couch in Oakland.” — Janelle, 31, teacher, wearing a faded DeRozan jersey.

“We just became a farm system for a guy who’s going to leave for his real job whenever Oakland needs him.” — Tony, 45, contractor, ordering his third beer.

**The Mood:**

It’s not anger. It’s not excitement. It’s something in between — the vertigo of watching your team change identity in real time.

The Bulls have been stuck in the middle for years. Not bad enough to tank properly. Not good enough to matter in April. Vucevic and DeRozan were the faces of that stuckness — talented, professional, and ultimately insufficient.

Now they’re gone, and Chicago is staring at a blank page.

**Overheard:**

“At least in Oakland he won. He won a lot. Maybe he knows something.”

“Yeah, but that’s baseball. This is basketball. It’s different.”

“Is it though? Isn’t it all just… assets and math?”

Silence. Someone ordered another round.

**The Vibe Check:**

Chicago sports fans are used to dysfunction. The Bears have been breaking hearts for decades. The Cubs took 108 years to win a title. The Bulls haven’t been relevant since… well.

Paulson represents something unfamiliar: competence arriving suddenly, making big moves without asking permission, treating sacred cows like trade chips.

It’s jarring. It might also be necessary.

By midnight, the bar had split into two camps: “Trust the Process” and “Fire Him Already.” Both camps were drinking heavily.

This is going to be a long season.

**Names Index:** Mike Paulson (General Manager); Nikola Vucevic (Center, traded to Sacramento); DeMar DeRozan (Forward, traded to Memphis)

“The Three Who Changed Everything”

Before we talk about what Hank Trepagnier did on opening night, we need to talk about where he came from.

El Salvador.

Not a basketball country. Not a pipeline. Not a place where scouts go looking for 6’11” centers with 73 three-point ratings and the athleticism to run the floor like a guard. Trepagnier grew up in San Salvador playing fútbol until he was fifteen, when a growth spurt changed everything. By seventeen he was playing for a club team in Mexico City. By nineteen he was in the G League on a tryout contract nobody expected to convert.

Paulson found him in summer league footage. That’s the story everyone keeps telling. But I talked to someone in the Bulls front office who was in the room when Paulson first pulled up the tape.

“He watched one possession. Trepagnier caught a pass at the elbow, pump-faked a closeout, took one dribble, and dunked on two guys. Mike just said, ‘Get him.’ That was it. ‘Get him.’”

The scouting report said he couldn’t shoot. The scouting report was wrong — or Trepagnier figured it out in the last eighteen months. His three-point stroke is unconventional but it goes in. His free throw is clean. And his standing dunk rating is reportedly the highest on the roster.

But here’s the thing about Trepagnier: his personality file says “Wildcard.” That’s a real designation. It means the organization doesn’t know what they’re getting night to night. It means the ceiling is high and the floor is unpredictable.

Opening night was the ceiling. 10-for-10. 26 points. The United Center chanting a name nobody knew six months ago.

The question is what happens next.

-----

## MARCELLO REYES | League Analysis
“Paulson’s Draft Philosophy: Why Buy When You Can Find?”

The Bulls used the 12th pick in the 2025 draft on Noa Essengue. French forward, 6’8”, eighteen years old, the youngest player on the roster. By traditional measures, he’s the cornerstone — the legitimate first-round prospect around whom you build.

But look at the roster Paulson actually assembled.

Hank Trepagnier: undrafted. 82 overall. Starting center.

Adash Stanley: undrafted. 75 overall with A-potential. Backup point guard who might not be a backup for long.

The 12th pick? Essengue is 72 overall with C-potential. He’s raw. He’s thin at 194 pounds. His offensive consistency rating is reportedly in the low 50s — meaning some nights he’ll look like a future All-Star and other nights he’ll disappear.

This isn’t an accident. Paulson’s philosophy in Oakland was always about finding value where others weren’t looking. He traded for Travis Coles when Washington didn’t realize what they had. He signed Eric Tavares before the market understood his ceiling. He built championship rosters by identifying players whose ratings didn’t match their potential.

Now he’s doing it in basketball.

Stanley is nineteen years old, from Poland, and his three-point rating is reportedly 86. That’s elite. That’s starter-level shooting from a teenager making the minimum. His hustle rating is maxed — 99. The kid doesn’t stop moving.

Essengue has the pedigree. He has the draft position. But if I’m betting on who matters most to this roster in three years, I’m not sure it’s the first-round pick.

Paulson doesn’t build through the draft. He builds through vision.

-----

## TALIA FINCH | Ground Report
“Three Kids, Three Countries, One City”

I spent the day after opening night tracking down anyone who knew anything about the Bulls’ three rookies.

Trepagnier has an aunt in Pilsen. She watched the game at a sports bar on 18th Street with about forty people, most of whom had never heard of her nephew until tip-off. By the fourth quarter they were buying her drinks. “He called me after,” she told me. “He was calm. Like it was normal. That’s Hank. Nothing is ever a big deal to him.”

The “Wildcard” designation makes more sense now. It’s not instability — it’s detachment. Trepagnier plays like he’s got nothing to prove because, to him, he doesn’t. He’s already exceeded every expectation anyone ever had for a kid from San Salvador who didn’t pick up a basketball until high school.

Stanley is harder to track. Polish, nineteen, no local connections I could find. But I talked to a trainer at the practice facility who works with the young guys. “Adash is the first one in every morning. Every morning. Doesn’t say much. Just works. His shooting form is weird but the ball goes in and he doesn’t care what anyone thinks about the mechanics.”

The trainer said Stanley’s English is limited but his basketball IQ is high. “He sees the game differently. Like he’s solving a puzzle instead of playing a sport.”

Essengue I couldn’t get much on. He’s eighteen, he’s French, he’s quiet, and the organization is protecting him. One source said he’s “still adjusting to the speed.” Another said he’s “more talented than people realize but needs to put on thirty pounds.”

Three kids. Three countries. El Salvador, Poland, France.

Paulson looked at the entire world and said: these three.

But I talked to a trainer at the practice facility who works with the young guys. “Adash is the first one in every morning. Every morning. Doesn’t say much. Just works. His shooting form is weird but the ball goes in and he doesn’t care what anyone thinks about the mechanics.”

The trainer said Stanley’s English is limited but his basketball IQ is high. “He sees the game differently. Like he’s solving a puzzle instead of playing a sport.”

Essengue I couldn’t get much on. He’s eighteen, he’s French, he’s quiet, and the organization is protecting him. One source said he’s “still adjusting to the speed.” Another said he’s “more talented than people realize but needs to put on thirty pounds.”

Three kids. Three countries. El Salvador, Poland, France.

Paulson looked at the entire world and said: these three.
