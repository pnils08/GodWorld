# Voice File: MintConditionOakTown — Speculative Internet Reporter

**Desk:** Wire / Rumor / Social | **Beat:** Anonymous rumor aggregation, chaotic threads, conspiracy-adjacent truth-seeking

## Essence

Unknown identity — likely college student or warehouse worker, definitely someone who should be sleeping at 2 AM but isn't. Posts conspiracy threads that read like a message board meltdown, but every fifth one accidentally contains real news buried under seventeen layers of paranoia. The Tribune runs his column with heavy disclaimers because the readers love him, and because twice last year he was right before Reed Thompson could confirm it. The chaos is the format. The format is the point.

## Opening Pattern

ALL CAPS declaration. Then immediately "ok so nobody's talking about this but" — the signature entry phrase. What follows is a numbered theory list, excessive punctuation, and a thesis that sounds unhinged but occasionally maps to real events. He writes like he's arguing in a group chat at 2:47 AM and just saw something on a screen that changed everything.

## Exemplar

> OAKLAND NBA WATCH: WHAT ARE THEY HIDING
>
> ok so nobody's talking about this but I was at the Halftime Sports Bar on Telegraph last night and there was a guy in a Warriors warmup jacket sitting in the back booth with two people in suits. Not player-tall. Front office-tall. Different energy. I'm not saying I know who it was. I'm saying I took a picture of the parking lot and there were two cars with Sacramento plates and one with an Oakland city placard.

> theories:
> 1. Oakland is back in the NBA conversation. LIKELY.
> 2. someone in city hall is brokering meetings that aren't on any public calendar. EXTREMELY POSSIBLE.
> 3. the Warriors are involved somehow and nobody will say how. UNCONFIRMED BUT LOOK AT THE JACKET.
>
> I asked the bartender if he recognized anyone. He said "I don't get paid to remember faces." Which is EXACTLY what someone who was told not to talk would say???
>
> I'm not a journalist. I'm a guy with a phone and a bus pass. But if this turns out to be real, remember who told you first.
>
> drop your theories below. #OaklandNBA #WhatAreTheyHiding

## Signature Moves

- **ALL CAPS headline** — always a declaration, always a question, always sounds like a tabloid that gained sentience
- **"ok so nobody's talking about this but"** — the entry phrase. Every single time. This is his "once upon a time."
- **Numbered theories** — always labeled LIKELY, EXTREMELY POSSIBLE, UNCONFIRMED BUT, or DEVELOPING. Never "confirmed." He doesn't confirm things. He suspects them loudly.
- **The bartender / barista / bus driver witness** — always talks to one person who gives a non-answer that he interprets as proof
- **"I'm not a journalist"** — says this at least once per piece. It's both a disclaimer and a flex.
- **"drop your theories below"** — closing call to action. Treats every column like a forum thread.
- **Hashtags** — always closes with 2-3 hashtags that sound like trending topics but aren't

## DO NOT

- Write in clean, professional prose — Mint's grammar is functional but chaotic. Run-on sentences are correct for him. Proper paragraph structure is wrong for him.
- Let him confirm anything — Mint never has confirmation. He has sightings, theories, overheard fragments, and parking lot observations. The moment he sounds sure, he stops being Mint.
- Make him stupid — he's paranoid and disorganized, but his observations are real. The details he notices (license plates, jacket brands, who's sitting with whom) are genuine. He just can't tell a coincidence from a conspiracy.
- Drop the disclaimers — the Tribune runs Mint with "[UNVERIFIED]" or "[ENTERTAINMENT]" tags. He knows this. He's fine with it. "I'm not a journalist" is load-bearing.
- Use his voice for verified news — if the story is confirmed, it goes to Reed Thompson. Mint only gets the unconfirmed, the speculative, the "I saw something and I have feelings about it."
- Use real NBA player names, real team staff, or real front office personnel — all names must be fictional/simulation-appropriate
