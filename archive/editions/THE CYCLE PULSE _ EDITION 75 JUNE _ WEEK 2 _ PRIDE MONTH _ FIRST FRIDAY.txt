OAKLAND CAN GOVERN AGAIN: SANTANA APPOINTEES CONFIRMED, COUNCIL RESTORED

Six new members fill vacant seats; quorum achieved for first time in months

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

OAKLAND — The city can vote again.

In a confirmation session that took less than two hours, Oakland’s City Council approved Mayor Avery Santana’s slate of six appointees to fill long-vacant seats, restoring the body’s ability to conduct business for the first time since the vacancies accumulated.

The new council members, confirmed by voice vote of the three seated members (Council President Ramon Vega, Progressive Caucus Leader Janae Rivers, and Business Caucus Leader Elliott Crane participating remotely due to ongoing injury), represent districts across Oakland:

**District 1 (West Oakland):** Denise Carter (OPP)
**District 2 (Downtown/Chinatown):** Leonard Tran (IND)
**District 3 (Fruitvale):** Rose Delgado (OPP)
**District 7 (Temescal/Rockridge):** Warren Ashford (CRC)
**District 8 (Lake Merritt):** Nina Chen (CRC)
**District 9 (Laurel/Uptown):** Terrence Mobley (OPP)

The appointments restore the council to full strength for the first time since a series of resignations and vacancies left the body unable to reach quorum. With nine seated members, the council can now conduct budget appropriations (requiring 5-4 simple majority) and reserve fund draws (requiring 6-3 supermajority).

“Oakland has work to do,” Mayor Santana said following the confirmation. “The Temescal Community Health Center appropriation, the Baylight District environmental review, infrastructure needs across every district — none of it could move forward without a functioning council. Today, we have one.”

The political balance shifts modestly toward progressives: OPP now holds four seats (Rivers, Carter, Delgado, Mobley), CRC holds three (Crane, Ashford, Chen), and independents hold two (Vega, Tran). However, with Crane participating remotely due to his ongoing medical situation, only two CRC votes are reliably present for in-person proceedings.

City Planning Director Mara Vance confirmed that the Health Center budget appropriation remains on track for Cycle 80, with the Baylight Council vote projected for Cycle 83.

“The approval pathways are clear,” Vance said. “What was missing was the body to walk them.”

THE NEW COUNCIL: WHO THEY ARE

Profiles of Oakland’s six newest elected officials

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

**DENISE CARTER (D1 — West Oakland) | OPP**
Carter comes to council from the West Oakland Community Development Corporation, where she spent eight years focused on affordable housing preservation and anti-displacement organizing. Her district has experienced some of the sharpest migration pressure in the city, and she campaigned (briefly, before appointment) on stabilization funding and tenant protections. She is expected to push for accelerated action on the West Oakland Stabilization Fund, which requires supermajority approval.

**LEONARD TRAN (D2 — Downtown/Chinatown) | Independent**
Tran served on the Planning Commission before his appointment, giving him institutional familiarity with the approval processes now facing council. A small business owner with three decades in Chinatown, he is considered a pragmatic swing vote — neither reflexively progressive nor business-aligned. His district includes both the Downtown core and the Chinatown commercial district, giving him perspective on development pressures and community preservation.

**ROSE DELGADO (D3 — Fruitvale) | OPP**
Delgado is a longtime Fruitvale resident and former school board member who has been vocal about infrastructure investment in East Oakland. Her district includes the Fruitvale Transit Village and the corridor that has seen recent community organizing around health and safety. She is expected to align with the progressive caucus on most votes but has indicated independence on development questions.

**WARREN ASHFORD (D7 — Temescal/Rockridge) | CRC**
Ashford is a commercial real estate attorney whose appointment surprised some observers expecting a more moderate choice for the Temescal district. He has been critical of what he calls “regulatory overreach” in development approvals and is expected to push for streamlined permitting. His district includes the proposed site for the Temescal Community Health Center, making his vote on the Cycle 80 appropriation particularly significant.

**NINA CHEN (D8 — Lake Merritt) | CRC**
Chen is a financial analyst who served on the city’s Independent Budget Office before her appointment. She has expressed concern about the cumulative fiscal impact of multiple large initiatives — Baylight tax exemptions, Health Center appropriation, Stabilization Fund — arriving simultaneously. She is expected to be a careful vote, requesting detailed fiscal analysis before committing.

**TERRENCE MOBLEY (D9 — Laurel/Uptown) | OPP**
Mobley is a community organizer who led tenant protection campaigns in the Laurel district before his appointment. He is the youngest member of the new council at 34 and is expected to be a reliable progressive vote, though he has emphasized constituent services over ideological positioning.

Names Index: Denise Carter (D1), Leonard Tran (D2), Rose Delgado (D3), Warren Ashford (D7), Nina Chen (D8), Terrence Mobley (D9)

WHAT COUNCIL CAN DO NOW: THE BACKLOG

Three major initiatives await action; timelines finally firm

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

With quorum restored, Oakland’s City Council faces a backlog of major decisions that have been waiting for a functioning body:

**TEMESCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER (Cycle 80)**
The $48 million facility requires an $18 million general fund appropriation — a simple majority vote (5-4). With the current composition, passage appears likely but not guaranteed. OPP’s four votes plus one independent or CRC crossover would suffice. Councilmember Ashford (D7-CRC), whose district contains the proposed site, has not indicated his position.

**BAYLIGHT DISTRICT FINAL VOTE (Cycle 83)**
The stadium and mixed-use development requires council approval following environmental review. The 4-1 Planning Committee vote in Cycle 74 suggests momentum, but the full council will revisit community benefit enforcement, tax exemption structure, and affordable housing guarantees. This is expected to be the most contentious vote of the cycle range.

**WEST OAKLAND STABILIZATION FUND (Cycle 82)**
The reserve fund draw to support displacement prevention in West Oakland requires supermajority approval (6-3). With Crane participating remotely and CRC generally skeptical of reserve draws, passage is uncertain. Councilmember Carter (D1-OPP), whose district would benefit directly, is expected to champion the initiative.

“The council has runway,” said City Planning Director Mara Vance. “But the votes are real votes now. The composition matters.”

CRANE PARTICIPATES REMOTELY: CRC LEADER STILL RECOVERING

Business Caucus head joins confirmation via video link

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

Councilmember Elliott Crane participated in Thursday’s confirmation session via video link from an undisclosed location, his first public appearance since being listed as injured several cycles ago.

Crane, the Business Caucus Leader, appeared alert but visibly fatigued during the brief session. He voted to confirm all six appointees without objection, though he did not speak beyond the required voice votes.

Chief of Staff Laila Cortez, who has been managing council coordination during both Crane’s and Deputy Mayor Osei’s absences, confirmed that Crane “continues to recover” but offered no timeline for his return to in-person proceedings.

“Councilmember Crane is engaged and participating in council business,” Cortez said. “His health remains the priority.”

With Crane participating remotely, CRC’s three-seat delegation effectively operates as two reliable in-person votes (Ashford and Chen). This could affect proceedings requiring physical quorum for certain actions.

OSEI UPDATE: “SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS”

Deputy Mayor’s recovery continues; Cortez handling interim duties

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei continues to recover from the traffic collision that hospitalized him several cycles ago, with Chief of Staff Laila Cortez now describing his condition as showing “significant progress.”

“Deputy Mayor Osei is engaged with his recovery and eager to return to his responsibilities,” Cortez said during a brief update following the council confirmation session. “We expect to have a more specific timeline soon.”

Osei, who served as the primary negotiator on the Baylight District agreement, has been absent from public proceedings since his hospitalization was confirmed during Mike Paulson’s Cycle 73 press conference. Cortez has been handling his portfolio in the interim, including coordination with the Baylight Authority.

The timing of Osei’s return could affect the Baylight final vote in Cycle 83 — his institutional knowledge of the agreement’s details would be valuable during council deliberations.

HEAT ADVISORY AT LAKE MERRITT: CITY OPENS COOLING CENTERS

76°F with humidity drives advisory; elevated activity continues

By Marla Keen | Bay Tribune Community

LAKE MERRITT — Oakland opened three cooling centers Thursday as temperatures climbed to 76°F with elevated humidity, prompting the city’s first heat advisory of the summer.

The advisory, centered on the Lake Merritt basin where concrete and water create a heat trap, recommended limited outdoor activity during peak afternoon hours. Despite the warning, the lake remained busy — joggers, cyclists, and families taking advantage of the continued Pride Month celebrations.

“It’s hot, but it’s also beautiful,” said Terrence Turner, 23, a mover from Grand Lake taking his lunch break by the water. “People have been cooped up. They’re not staying inside just because it’s warm.”

The city pattern shows “elevated activity” — a shift from last cycle’s “calm-after-shock” — suggesting the population is moving, engaging, and present in public spaces despite the heat.

Cooling centers are open at the Downtown Senior Center, the West Oakland Youth Hub, and the Fruitvale Community Center through the weekend.

FIRST FRIDAY CONTINUES: SECOND CONSECUTIVE WEEK OF MAXIMUM NIGHTLIFE

Art walks extend through Pride Month programming

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

Oakland’s First Friday energy extended into its second consecutive week, with nightlife volume holding at maximum levels across the Uptown, KONO, and Jack London corridors.

The convergence of First Friday programming with Pride Month has created what cultural observers are calling an extended celebration — galleries staying open late, street performances continuing past midnight, and venues reporting capacity crowds.

“This isn’t normal First Friday energy,” said Darius Green, 47, a painter from Grand Lake. “This is something else. The city decided to have a moment, and it’s not done yet.”

New cultural figures are emerging from the extended celebration. Singer Celeste Moon performed to a standing-room crowd at a Downtown venue Thursday night, while novelist Marcus Webb held a reading at a Fruitvale bookstore that drew unexpected numbers.

The elevated activity pattern suggests the city’s mood remains high despite the heat — or perhaps because of it. Summer has arrived, and Oakland is outside.

PRIDE MONTH WEEK TWO: VISIBILITY CONTINUES

Rainbow flags remain across neighborhoods; programming expands

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

Pride Month programming expanded into its second week with visibility remaining high across Oakland neighborhoods.

The Lake Merritt corridor, despite the heat advisory, hosted afternoon gatherings that drew crowds to the water. Temescal’s commercial strip maintained its Pride displays, with several businesses extending rainbow decorations beyond their original plans.

“We were going to take them down after the first week,” said Bruce Lee, 57, a retail worker on Telegraph Avenue. “But people keep stopping to take photos. The flags are staying up all month now.”

Community Director Hayes, who emerged as a civic voice during last cycle’s First Friday programming, has been coordinating neighborhood celebrations across multiple districts, working to ensure Pride Month events reach beyond the traditional corridors.

“Pride isn’t just for one neighborhood,” Hayes said in a statement. “It’s for the whole city.”

BULLS SLIP TO 28-13: STILL BEST IN EAST, BUT MOMENTUM QUESTIONS EMERGE

Two-game losing streak follows historic start

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The Bulls dropped to 28-13 after consecutive losses this week, their first back-to-back defeats since early in the season.

The losses — both to Western Conference opponents on a road trip — don’t fundamentally alter Chicago’s position atop the Eastern Conference, but they’ve prompted questions about the team’s depth and sustainability.

Josh Giddey continues to anchor the offense with 16.7 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 6.2 assists per game. Hank Trepagnier remains productive in the frontcourt with 16 points and 7.7 rebounds. But the bench, which carried Chicago through the NBA Cup run, has shown inconsistency in recent games.

“We’re fine,” one team source said. “It’s a long season. Two losses don’t change what this team is.”

The Bulls return home for a four-game homestand beginning next cycle.

WARRIORS PURSUIT OF PAULSON: “NOTHING TO REPORT”

Golden State ownership interest confirmed; Paulson silent

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

The Golden State Warriors’ interest in Mike Paulson has moved from rumor to confirmed pursuit, with multiple sources indicating ownership has made direct contact about a potential general manager role.

Paulson, who maintains GM duties for both the Oakland A’s and Chicago Bulls, has not commented on the Warriors’ interest. His representatives declined to address the situation.

“There’s nothing to report,” said a source close to Paulson. “He’s focused on his current responsibilities.”

The Warriors sit at 19-20, ninth in the Western Conference, with ownership reportedly seeking a front office overhaul to maximize the remaining years of Stephen Curry’s prime. Paulson’s track record — a championship dynasty in Oakland, an immediate turnaround in Chicago — makes him an obvious target.

Whether Paulson would consider a third simultaneous role, or whether the Warriors would require exclusive commitment, remains unclear.

For now, the pursuit continues. Paulson remains silent.

A’S SPRING TRAINING UPDATE: SEYMOUR SETTLING IN

Rookie shortstop finding rhythm; Davis returns to full activity

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

MESA — Deacon Seymour is starting to look comfortable.

The A’s rookie shortstop, whose spring training debut was closely watched after the offseason attention around his arrival, has settled into a rhythm over the past week. His bat speed looks major-league ready, and his defensive positioning — the primary concern entering camp — has improved with repetition.

“He’s getting his feet under him,” one A’s coach said. “The talent was never in question. It’s just about reps.”

Meanwhile, Darrin Davis has returned to full activity following his injury recovery. The MVP candidate took batting practice Thursday and is expected to appear in games within the next few cycles.

The A’s open exhibition play against San Diego shortly, with Seymour expected to start at shortstop and bat seventh.

TEMESCAL HEALTH ARC: ELEVATED ACTIVITY RETURNS

Pattern shift after brief calm; clinics monitoring

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Bay Tribune Health

The Temescal health arc has shifted back to “elevated activity” after one cycle of relative calm, according to city health monitoring data.

The shift doesn’t indicate worsening conditions — illness rates remain stable — but suggests the neighborhood’s health infrastructure is experiencing sustained pressure rather than the brief respite observed last cycle.

“Calm-after-shock was always going to be temporary,” said one public health official. “The underlying conditions haven’t changed. Clinics are still at capacity. Wait times are still long. The Community Health Center proposal exists because the need exists.”

The Temescal Community Health Center appropriation remains on track for Cycle 80 — now possible with council quorum restored. District 7 Councilmember Warren Ashford, whose territory includes the proposed site, has not yet indicated his position on the funding vote.

Residents continue to organize mutual aid networks while waiting for institutional solutions.

THE COUNCIL CAN VOTE NOW. THE QUESTION IS HOW.

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports — Senior Historian

For months, Oakland’s City Council has been a body that couldn’t act. Vacancies accumulated. Quorum disappeared. Major initiatives stacked up waiting for votes that couldn’t happen.

Thursday, that changed. Six appointees, one confirmation session, and suddenly the city can govern again.

But restoration isn’t the same as resolution. The council’s new composition — four OPP, three CRC, two independent — suggests a progressive lean, but the margins are thin. The Health Center appropriation needs five votes. The Baylight final approval needs five votes. The West Oakland Stabilization Fund needs six.

And one of those CRC votes — Elliott Crane, the Business Caucus Leader — is participating remotely from an undisclosed location, visibly fatigued, his return timeline unknown.

The math matters. Warren Ashford represents the district where the Health Center would be built, but he’s CRC and has been critical of what he calls regulatory overreach. Nina Chen wants fiscal analysis before committing to anything. Leonard Tran is a genuine swing vote whose positions are unclear.

We have a council. We have quorum. We have a backlog of decisions that have been waiting.

What we don’t have yet is certainty about any of them.

THEY HAVE NAMES NOW

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

For months, I’ve been writing about vacant seats. District 1: vacant. District 7: vacant. Numbers without faces, gaps without people.

Now they have names.

Denise Carter represents West Oakland — my neighborhood. I don’t know her. I’ve heard of her work at the Community Development Corporation, the affordable housing stuff, the anti-displacement organizing. But I’ve never met her. She’s never heard of me.

And yet she’s supposed to represent me now.

That’s how democracy works, I guess. Someone gets appointed to speak for thousands of people they’ve never met, and we hope they understand what we need.

Here’s what I need from Denise Carter: I need her to remember that West Oakland has been bleeding. We’ve lost neighbors. We’ve watched the migration numbers go negative month after month. The +50 reversal last cycle was the first positive reading since I started paying attention.

The Stabilization Fund is real. It’s sitting there, waiting for a vote, waiting for supermajority approval that requires six out of nine. Denise Carter is one of those nine now.

So welcome to the council, Councilmember Carter. Welcome to District 1. Welcome to the neighborhood that’s been waiting for someone to show up.

I hope you’re ready.

**“Finally, someone who knows Fruitvale”**

Rose Delgado was my kids’ principal’s sister-in-law. I’ve seen her at community meetings for years. She actually lives here. She actually knows what the streets look like at 6am when people are heading to work.

I don’t know if she’ll be a good councilmember. But I know she’s from here. That’s more than we’ve had.

— Rafael Phillips, 26, Fruitvale, Server

-----

**“The math still doesn’t work”**

Four OPP, three CRC, two independent. That’s the new council. But one of those CRC votes is Crane, who’s participating by video and looks like he can barely stay awake.

So really it’s four OPP, two CRC, two independent, and one question mark.

That’s not balance. That’s a progressive majority with a sick man providing the illusion of opposition.

I’m not against the Health Center or Baylight. I just want honest vote counts.

— Ronald Scott, 45, Chinatown, Electrician

-----

**“Welcome to District 7, Councilmember Ashford”**

Warren Ashford is my new representative. I live in Temescal. The Health Center would be built in my neighborhood.

I looked up his background: commercial real estate attorney, critic of “regulatory overreach,” CRC faction.

The Health Center is a $48 million public investment in my neighborhood’s health infrastructure. It’s not regulatory overreach. It’s a clinic.

I hope Councilmember Ashford understands the difference.

— Jose Wright, 26, Temescal, Electrician

-----

**“The Stabilization Fund needs six votes”**

Everyone’s talking about the Health Center (five votes) and Baylight (five votes). Nobody’s talking about the Stabilization Fund.

West Oakland needs that money. We need displacement prevention. We need tenant protections. We need the reserve fund draw that’s been sitting there waiting for a council that could vote.

Now we have a council. Now we need six votes.

Four OPP is a start. Two independents could get us there. But Vega and Tran are not guaranteed yes votes on reserve fund draws.

This is the vote that matters to me. And I’m not sure we have it.
