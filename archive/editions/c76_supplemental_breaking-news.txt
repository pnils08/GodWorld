SANTANA UNVEILS ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE INITIATIVE: CIVILIAN TEAMS FOR MENTAL HEALTH, WELLNESS CALLS

$12.5M program redirects 42,000 annual calls from police; OPOA calls it “defunding by another name”

By Carmen Delaine | Civic Ledger

Mayor Avery Santana announced the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative today — the most politically charged proposal of her administration.

The program deploys trained civilian responders to mental health crises, wellness checks, and non-violent calls currently handled by police. No weapons. No handcuffs. Licensed clinicians, EMTs, social workers, and community responders answering calls that don’t require armed response.

“Match the response to the call,” Santana said at a press conference outside City Hall. “Officers shouldn’t spend their time on mental health calls. They’re not trained for it. This adds responders. It doesn’t remove anyone.”

**BY THE NUMBERS**

- 42,000 divertible calls annually (28% of non-emergency dispatch)
- 72 civilian responders across three team types
- Year 1 budget: $12.5M
- $8.2M reallocated from OPD overtime — not new spending
- Pilot districts: West Oakland and Fruitvale (Year 3, Q2)
- Council vote: Cycle 82 (simple majority required)

**THE THREE TEAMS**

CARE Teams handle mental health crises, suicide concerns, and emotional disturbances. One licensed clinician, one EMT. Unmarked SUV, medical equipment, no weapons.

COMMUNITY Teams handle wellness checks, neighbor disputes, noise complaints, and non-violent trespassing. Two trained community responders. Marked city vehicle, no weapons.

OUTREACH Teams handle homeless and encampment calls, intoxicated persons, and service connections. One social worker, one outreach specialist. Van with supplies and resource materials.

**THE FUNDING FIGHT**

The $8.2M city allocation comes from OPD overtime budget — not new spending, not officer salaries, not patrol staffing. But the Oakland Police Officers Association isn’t making that distinction.

“This is defunding by another name,” said OPOA President Vincent Ramirez. “You can call it reallocation, you can call it alternative response, you can call it whatever you want. The result is the same: less money for public safety when crime is up.”

Ramirez announced the union would oppose the initiative “with everything we have.”

Chief Rafael Montez offered measured neutrality: “The department will work with whatever model the city approves. Our focus is public safety.”

**THE COMPARISON DATA**

Santana’s office cited programs in Denver, San Francisco, Portland, and Albuquerque as models.

Denver’s STAR program: $11.2M budget, 12,000 calls diverted annually. Zero use-of-force incidents since launch.

San Francisco Street Crisis Response: $18.5M budget, 21,000 calls diverted. Lower re-contact rates than police response.

“Every city that’s tried this has seen the same results,” Santana said. “People in crisis get help instead of handcuffs. Officers get freed up for actual crimes. Nobody gets hurt.”

**THE VOTE**

The initiative requires a simple majority — five votes. The math is tight.

**Current projection:** 4 likely yes, 2 undecided, 3 likely no

**Path to passage:** OPP bloc (4) + one independent (Vega or Tran) = 5

**Path to defeat:** CRC bloc (3) + both independents = 5

This is a true toss-up. The swing votes — Vega and Tran — will face pressure from both sides. Whoever’s up for re-election in a contested district feels it most.

SANTANA’S BETTING HER LEGACY ON SOMETHING THAT ALREADY WORKS

By Farrah Del Rio | Civic & Cultural Opinion

Avery Santana spent fifteen years suing police departments.

She knows what happens when the wrong responder shows up to the wrong call. The wellness check that becomes a use-of-force incident. The mental health crisis that ends in arrest instead of treatment. The homeless man who needed a sandwich and got a citation.

Now she’s mayor. And she’s doing something about it.

The Alternative Response Initiative isn’t radical. It’s not experimental. Denver’s been doing it for years. San Francisco. Portland. Albuquerque. Zero use-of-force incidents. Lower re-contact rates. People in crisis actually getting help.

Vincent Ramirez calls it “defunding by another name.” He’s wrong, and he knows he’s wrong. The $8.2M comes from overtime budget, not officer salaries. Not patrol. Not investigations. Overtime.

But “defunding” is a better talking point than “we’re reallocating overtime funds to civilian responders for calls that don’t require armed response.” So that’s what he’ll say. That’s what the mailers will say. That’s what the pressure campaign on Vega and Tran will say.

Here’s what the data says: every hour we send a cop to a wellness check is an hour they’re not stopping actual crime. Every mental health crisis that ends in handcuffs instead of treatment creates a re-contact. Every encounter that escalates because the responder had a gun and not training costs the city in lawsuits, in trust, in lives.

Santana’s not defunding anything. She’s trying to match the response to the call. Armed officers for armed situations. Trained civilians for everything else.

The police union will spend the next six cycles telling Oakland this is dangerous. The results from every other city say otherwise.

Ramon Vega and Leonard Tran are going to decide this. They’re going to get pressure from OPOA, from business groups, from law-and-order constituencies. They’re also going to get pressure from mental health advocates, from homeless services providers, from the progressive coalition that put Santana in office.

This is the vote that defines whether Oakland moves forward or stays stuck.

Santana’s betting her political capital. I’m betting she’s right.

“THEY SENT FOUR COPS FOR MY BROTHER”: PILOT DISTRICT RESIDENTS ON ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE

By Luis Navarro | Managing Editor

WEST OAKLAND / FRUITVALE — The calls that would go to OARI teams aren’t hypothetical. They’re happening every day. The Bay Tribune spoke with residents in the two pilot districts about what alternative response could mean for their communities.

-----

**Tariq Harris, 26, Dental Assistant — West Oakland**

Harris’s brother has schizophrenia. Last year, a neighbor called 911 during an episode.

“They sent four cops,” Harris said. “Four. My brother was in the backyard talking to himself. He wasn’t hurting anyone. He wasn’t threatening anyone. He was having an episode.”

The officers detained his brother for three hours. No charges. No treatment. Just handcuffs, a squad car, and a trip to Highland that ended with discharge and no follow-up.

“If someone had shown up who actually knew what they were doing — a clinician, someone trained — maybe he gets connected to services. Maybe he gets help. Instead he got traumatized, and now he won’t go outside when he’s struggling because he’s afraid someone will call the cops again.”

Harris supports OARI. “It’s not about hating police. It’s about sending the right person to the right call.”

-----

**Darius Clark, 40, Bakery Worker — West Oakland**

Clark works early mornings. He’s seen the calls that happen before dawn — the wellness checks, the encampment sweeps, the intoxicated person asleep on a bench.

“I’ve watched cops wake up homeless guys at four in the morning,” Clark said. “What’s the guy gonna do? He’s sleeping. He’s not bothering anyone. But somebody complained, so now there’s two officers standing over him with flashlights.”

He shook his head.

“Send someone with a blanket and a sandwich. Send someone who can tell him where the shelter is. Don’t send someone with a gun to handle a guy who needs a meal.”

-----

**Elijah Young, 35, Security Guard — Fruitvale**

Young works overnight security at a retail complex on International Boulevard. He’s the one who usually calls 911 when something happens.

“I’ve called for mental health stuff maybe ten times in the last two years,” Young said. “Every time, I get cops. And every time, I’m standing there thinking, this person needs a doctor, not an arrest.”

He described a recent call — a woman in the parking lot, clearly in crisis, yelling at cars. Young called 911. Two officers arrived.

“They talked to her for maybe five minutes, couldn’t get her to leave, so they put her in the car. I don’t know where she went. I don’t know if she got help. I just know she was back the next week.”

Young wants a different option. “Let me call someone who can actually help. That’s all I’m asking.”

-----

**Omar Clark, 27, Line Cook — Fruitvale**

Clark works late nights at a restaurant on International. He’s seen the street at 2 AM — the calls that come in, the responses that don’t match.

“There’s a guy who hangs out near the dumpsters,” Clark said. “Everybody knows him. He’s harmless. But every couple weeks somebody calls, and the cops show up, and they move him along, and then he’s back the next night.”

He leaned against the wall.

“What if someone showed up who could actually get him into housing? What if instead of moving him along, they moved him somewhere? That’s what this program is supposed to do, right?”

-----

**Ivy Tran, 34, Driver — Fruitvale**

Tran drives for a rideshare service. She’s picked up people in crisis — passengers who shouldn’t have been in a car, who needed help she couldn’t provide.

“I had a fare last month,” Tran said. “Woman got in, clearly not okay. Talking to herself, agitated, kept asking me to take her somewhere that didn’t exist. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t just leave her on the street. I couldn’t take her where she wanted to go because it wasn’t a real place.”

She ended up driving to a hospital and walking the woman inside. No fare. An hour of her night.

“If there was a number I could call — not 911, not cops, just someone who handles this — I would have called it. I didn’t know what else to do.”

COMMUNITY RESPONSE
############################################################

ADVOCACY GROUPS PRAISE INITIATIVE; OPOA ANNOUNCES OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN

By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison

The response to OARI split along predictable lines — with some surprises.

**SUPPORT:**

Bay Area Mental Health Coalition called the initiative “long overdue.”

“We’ve been asking for this for years,” said coalition director Dr. Anita Reeves. “People in mental health crisis need clinicians, not officers. This program gets that right.”

Homeless services providers praised the OUTREACH team model.

“Connection to services is everything,” said Marcus Delgado, director of Oakland Housing First. “You can’t arrest your way out of homelessness. You have to meet people where they are and offer them something better.”

**OPPOSITION:**

OPOA President Vincent Ramirez held a press conference within hours of Santana’s announcement.

“The mayor wants to take eight million dollars from public safety and give it to social workers,” Ramirez said. “Meanwhile, violent crime is up. Property crime is up. Response times are up. This is not the time to experiment with public safety.”

Ramirez announced a campaign to pressure council members, including mailers to homeowners in swing districts and a public safety town hall in District 4 — Ramon Vega’s district.

“We’re going to make sure voters know exactly what this proposal means,” Ramirez said. “And we’re going to make sure their council members hear from them.”

**THE MIDDLE:**

Fire Department leadership, which would house the civilian OARI division, offered cautious support.

“This is a new mission for the department,” said Battalion Chief Teresa Huang. “We’re prepared to take it on if the council approves. We’ve been in conversations with Mayor Santana’s office for months.”

The 911 dispatchers union raised workload concerns but stopped short of opposition.

“Triage is complicated,” said union representative David Okonkwo. “We want to make sure dispatchers have the training and support to make these calls correctly. If the city invests in that, we can make this work.”
