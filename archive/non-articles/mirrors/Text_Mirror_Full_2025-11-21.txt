Lore Summary
Miguel Casillas rose from Pennsylvania with the poise of a professor and the power of a craftsman.
Drafted in 2026, he developed a reputation for cerebral precision — commanding his fastball like
punctuation. From Colorado’s early grind to Tampa Bay’s stability and Oakland’s contender years,
Casillas matured into one of baseball’s few true workhorses.
By 2038, he had reached his peak — a Cy Young and MVP in the same season, leading the league in
efficiency and control. His transition to Chicago brought experience and depth to a team searching for
stability. Casillas’s legacy is that of a pitcher who aged with intellect — power diminished, but precision
sharpened — a symbol of longevity and craft in the A’s Dynasty continuum.

Lore Summary
Tre’ Morgan brought the heartbeat of Louisiana baseball to Oakland’s dugout — a natural leader and
an unselfish professional who prioritized team balance over personal numbers. A defensive standout at
first base with quick instincts and a strong arm, his Gold Glove campaign in 2037 underscored years of
consistency. Though his bat rarely made headlines, his presence did — Morgan was the quiet stabilizer
on a roster filled with stars, bridging eras with reliability and grace.
Even as his career carried him to Cincinnati and Minnesota, his best seasons remained intertwined with
Oakland’s transitional dynasty — a player who defined loyalty through the grind.

Lore Summary
Steve Conrad stands as one of the most balanced offensive forces of the 2030s — a switch-hitter 
who merged patience and precision with raw power. Drafted out of Illinois in 2028, his rise 
through Chicago’s system culminated in back-to-back Hank Aaron Awards and multiple Silver 
Slugger awards as the heart of the White Sox order.

Conrad later carried his consistent excellence to Oakland and Philadelphia, evolving into a 
cornerstone veteran presence. With a career .286 average and over 300 home runs, his résumé 
captures both the artistry and endurance of the modern professional hitter — 
a true architect of contact, control, and composure.

Lore Summary
Paul Skenes, the towering right-hander from California, became one of baseball’s generational arms
after being selected in the first round of the 2023 draft. His blistering fastball — regularly clocked at
102 mph — and his signature “Outlier I” trait made him a nightmare for hitters throughout the late
2020s and early 2030s. He burst onto the scene by winning Rookie of the Year in 2024 and capturing a
Cy Young Award in 2029, anchoring a Pirates rotation that defined the franchise’s revival. After
impactful stops in San Diego and Oakland, Skenes closed his career with over 1 500 strikeouts and a
3.14 ERA — a legacy built on power, precision, and longevity.

Lore Summary
Orion Kerkering’s career bridged two decades of bullpen evolution. The California-born righty, drafted
in the fifth round by Philadelphia in 2022, forged a fourteen-year career marked by stamina,
adaptability, and an uncanny ability to neutralize left-handed hitters with his devastating sweeper.
After his early Phillies tenure, he became a stabilizing force for Oakland’s relief corps through the
2030s, logging over 1,000 innings and nearly 1,000 strikeouts. His signature three-pitch mix—95 mph
sinker, 98 mph four-seamer, and 86 mph sweeper—anchored multiple postseason runs before
concluding his career with Kansas City.
Quietly effective and deeply durable, Kerkering symbolizes the archetype of the long-haul reliever:
rarely flashy, always reliable.

Lore Summary
Kris Bubic, the Californian left-hander drafted in the first round of 2018, enjoyed a seventeen-year
Major-League career defined by durability and adaptability. Joining Oakland during the late-2020s, he
became the veteran pillar of the Athletics’ rotation through the franchise’s transition period—bridging
the dynasty’s bullpen-era dominance into a new generation of starters. Twice an All-Star (2022, 2033),
Bubic’s command of the sinker-changeup mix and quiet composure made him a steady influence in
clubhouses across Kansas City, Oakland, San Diego, Pittsburgh, Toronto, and Miami. He retired in
2040 with 161 wins, 2 128 strikeouts, and over 2 600 innings pitched, leaving behind a record of
steadiness emblematic of baseball’s journeyman elite.

Lore Summary
Dalton Rushing, the steady left-handed backstop from Tennessee, rose from the Dodgers’ 2022
first-round pick to become one of the Athletics’ most reliable and productive catchers of the 2030s. A
three-time Silver Slugger and three-time Gold Glove winner, Rushing embodied durability and
leadership behind the plate. During Oakland’s Dynasty extension years, he served as the offensive
anchor for multiple playoff runs, combining defensive excellence with consistent .280-range hitting and
20-plus home run power. His versatility across first base and corner outfield roles further cemented his
value as a franchise pillar during the transition era.

Lore Summary:
Carlos Chávez emerged from Panama as a precision reliever with a surgeon’s touch and a closer’s edge. 
His mastery of the cutter-changeup-slider trio defined him as one of the Athletics’ most trusted bullpen arms through the late 2030s. 
Known for control, composure, and consistency, Chávez anchored the middle innings — a stabilizer who never chased headlines but always delivered results. 
By the time he joined Los Angeles in 2039, his craft had matured into art: a reliable late-inning option with over 150 holds and nearly 400 innings of work. 
His ERA told the truth — steady, unspectacular, and indispensable. In a dynasty of fire and flash, Chávez was the quiet engineer of calm.
