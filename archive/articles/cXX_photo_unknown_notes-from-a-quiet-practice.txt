NOTES FROM A QUIET PRACTICE

The best part of a calm week isn’t the standings.
It’s the space.

This afternoon’s practice at the Coliseum felt like a photograph waiting to be taken: outfielders moving at half-speed, soft toss echoing under the upper deck, a bullpen session cutting through the silence on the third-base side.

No one pressing.
No one rushing.
No one carrying the world.

Just baseball breathing at its normal rhythm — the kind of rhythm you never get once the games tighten again.
