The Long March to Light
Mesa, Arizona — March 2040
The desert light hits differently when a team is trying to remember who it used to be.  Out here in Mesa, the mornings start with the faint crack of wood against leather — not loud enough to echo, but steady enough to remind you that rhythm is a kind of faith.  The palm trees don’t move, and neither do the ghosts.  They just watch as another spring begins, and as old bodies and young hearts take turns chasing the same sun.
Benji Dillon is back, one more year on his own terms.  He doesn’t throw as hard anymore, but the sound of his ball popping the mitt still makes rookies look up.  Ten wins, ten losses, four point twenty-six earned run average last season, and none of it matters now.  What matters is that he’s here — the old general walking the field in cleats that still remember champagne.  He tells John Ellis to breathe slower, pitch quieter, as if control isn’t just a command but a kind of meditation.
John Brever works two mounds away, tinkering with his delivery under the thin morning haze.  Ten and ten again, five point fifty-one earned run average, his command slipping the way the years do.  He doesn’t chase youth anymore; he just tries to earn his innings back one honest pitch at a time.  Watching him, you realize that baseball’s truest mirror isn’t victory — it’s repetition.  The daily grind of men refusing to let go of the game that once gave them everything.
I sat in the bleachers this morning beside an old usher who’s worked every spring since two thousand twenty-seven.  He said, “It feels lighter this year, like they finally stopped mourning.”  Maybe he’s right.  The city back home is breathing again after a long winter, carried by columns and voices that reminded it what baseball still means.  Maybe this isn’t rebirth.  Maybe it’s just resurrection — earned by patience, built by habit, and carried by those who still show up before the sun does.
And as that sun rises higher, the sound of practice turns into something like music.  Not the kind that wins parades, but the kind that keeps a soul from going quiet.  That’s what this spring feels like — the long march to light, slow but steady, as Oakland remembers how to be alive again.
