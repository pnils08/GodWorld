## TEMESCAL GETS ITS HEALTH CENTER -- BUT ASHFORD VOTED NO

**By Carmen Delaine | Civic Ledger**

The Temescal Community Health Center appropriation passed the Oakland City Council on Thursday evening, 6-2. It was not close.

The four Oakland People's Party members -- Denise Carter, Rose Delgado, Janae Rivers, and Terrence Mobley -- voted yes as a bloc. Both independents crossed with them: Ramon Vega voted yes without hesitation, and Leonard Tran, who had been listed as a toss-up going into the session, voted yes as well. Elliott Crane, the District 6 CRC member still recovering from his broken leg, was absent. His seat was empty. No remote connection this time.

That left Warren Ashford and Nina Chen alone on the no side. Two votes. Against a $45 million health center in Ashford's own district.

District 7 includes Temescal. The health center will be built on Telegraph Avenue, in the neighborhood Ashford represents. His constituents have been asking for expanded clinic access for more than a year, and the Tribune has reported on worsening health indicators in the area across multiple weeks of coverage. Appointment wait times at the existing Temescal clinic have stretched past six weeks. Walk-in capacity has been strained since spring.

Ashford voted no anyway.

He did not speak during floor debate. He did not issue a statement after the vote. His office responded to the Tribune's request for comment with a single-line email: "Councilmember Ashford's vote reflects his assessment of the city's fiscal capacity."

That sentence is doing a lot of work. It positions the no vote as fiscal conservatism rather than opposition to the health center itself. But fiscal conservatism with only one ally is not a coalition position. It is a personal one.

Two weeks ago, Crane crossed the aisle to pass the West Oakland Stabilization Fund on a 6-3 vote. At the time, the question was whether Crane's defection had cracked the CRC foundation. Thursday's vote suggests the crack is wider than anyone in the coalition wants to admit. Crane didn't cross this time -- he didn't show up at all. Ashford and Chen cast their no votes to an empty chair on one side and a six-vote majority on the other.

The CRC is now 0 for 2 on blocking appropriations this summer. The coalition that was supposed to hold the fiscal line has managed two no votes out of a possible three on consecutive major spending measures. Whether that is a strategy or a collapse depends on what happens when the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative reaches the floor in two weeks.

Jose Johnson, a sixty-two-year-old warehouse worker who lives on Claremont Avenue in Temescal, sat in the gallery through the entire session. He has been waiting nine weeks for a follow-up appointment at the Telegraph Avenue clinic after a back injury.

"I don't understand what fiscal capacity means when I can't see a doctor," Johnson said afterward, standing in the hallway outside the council chamber. "The center's coming. That's what matters. But my own councilmember voted against it. I'm going to remember that."

The appropriation now moves to the city administrator's office for implementation planning. No timeline has been announced for construction or site preparation, though Councilwoman Carter, who sponsored the measure, told reporters she expects a preliminary framework within thirty days.

The $45 million budget makes this the second-largest appropriation the council has passed this summer, behind only the $28 million Stabilization Fund. That fund is now inside its forty-five-day disbursement clock, and Beverly Hayes at the West Oakland Neighbors Association has been fielding calls at the Peralta Street office about eligibility and timelines.

Darius Clark, a forty-year-old bakery worker in West Oakland, went to the Neighbors Association office on Monday to ask about rental assistance.

"They gave me a form and told me to wait," Clark said. "Nobody could tell me when the money actually starts moving. The form exists. The money -- I don't know."

Two major appropriations are now moving through the city's administrative pipeline simultaneously, and the council still has the OARI and the Baylight District final vote ahead. The system is not breaking. But Ashford is standing in his own district's way, and as of Thursday evening, his district knows it.

## THE MAILERS KEEP COMING -- AND NOBODY ON COUNCIL IS TALKING ABOUT THEM

**By Luis Navarro | Investigations**

On Saturday afternoon, Dante Nelson pulled three pieces of mail from the box outside his apartment building on Grand Avenue in Adams Point. Two were bills. The third was a glossy, full-color mailer from the Oakland Police Officers Association.

Nelson, a forty-one-year-old security guard, read it standing on the sidewalk. He read it again. Then he folded it in half and put it in his back pocket.

"It's the third one this month," Nelson said. "They're not subtle about what they want."

The Oakland Police Officers Association has been running a pressure campaign in District 4 for the past several weeks, targeting the constituency of Councilmember Ramon Vega. The campaign's focus is the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative, a proposal that would create a civilian-led crisis response team to handle mental health calls, substance abuse incidents, and low-level disturbances -- calls that currently go to OPD patrol officers.

The OARI comes before the full council in two weeks. It needs five votes to pass.

Here is what we know about the current count. The four OPP members -- Carter, Delgado, Rivers, and Mobley -- are expected to vote yes. The three CRC members -- Crane, Ashford, and Chen -- are expected to vote no. That leaves two independents: Vega and Tran.

The OPOA is not spending money on mailers in Tran's district. They are spending it in Vega's.

I reached out to Vega's office three times this week. The first time, a staffer said the councilmember was reviewing the proposal. The second time, the same staffer said Vega would make his position clear before the vote. The third time, nobody answered.

Tran's office was marginally more responsive. A spokesperson said Tran "is listening to constituents and will evaluate the final proposal text," which is a sentence designed to communicate nothing.

The silence is the story.

The OARI has been in committee for months. Public comment sessions have been held. The proposal text has been circulated. The OPOA has made its opposition visible -- not through testimony at council hearings, but through a direct mail campaign aimed at the swing vote's neighborhood.

Ronald Wright, a thirty-five-year-old taxi driver who lives on Broadway near 27th Street downtown, said he received a mailer at his girlfriend's apartment in Adams Point last week.

"I don't even vote in District 4," Wright said. "But I got the mailer. Somebody's casting a wide net."

The OARI is modeled on programs in other cities that route non-violent crisis calls to trained civilian responders rather than armed officers. Supporters argue it reduces use-of-force incidents and frees police for higher-priority work. The OPOA's position, stated publicly at a forum in the Fruitvale several weeks ago, is that the initiative creates response gaps and undermines officer safety.

What has not happened is any public rebuttal from the initiative's sponsors. Councilwoman Rivers, who introduced the OARI, has not held a town hall or public event in District 4. Carter's office, which co-sponsored, has not responded to the mailer campaign with literature of its own. The OPP caucus appears to be counting on its four votes and waiting for Vega to come to them.

That is a strategy. Whether it is a good one depends on what Vega is hearing when he goes home to Adams Point.

Devon Green, a sixty-year-old delivery driver who has lived downtown for two decades, put it plainly. "The police union is the only one talking to people in their mailboxes," Green said, standing outside the Broadway corridor post office on Wednesday. "You can have the votes on the council floor. But if the guy who decides hasn't heard from your side, that's a problem."

Two weeks. Five votes needed. Two swing voters uncommitted. One organized opposition campaign. No visible counter-campaign.

The OARI may still pass. But right now, the loudest voice in the room belongs to the people who want it to fail.

## THREE WEEKS TO THE BIGGEST VOTE IN OAKLAND -- AND THE PAPER TRAIL IS THIN

**By Carmen Delaine | Civic Ledger**

Three weeks from now, the Oakland City Council will vote on the Baylight District, a $2.1 billion waterfront development that includes a new stadium for the Oakland Athletics, mixed-use commercial and residential construction, and a variable tax exemption structure tied to the city's economic performance. It is the largest single development vote in Oakland's modern history.

The environmental review is underway. Community input sessions are supposed to be happening. The relationship between the A's organization, led by Mark Aitken, and the council has been described by multiple offices as "productive." The project cleared the Planning Committee weeks ago on a 4-1 vote with conditions attached.

And yet, as of this week, the public record on the environmental review is remarkably thin.

The city's planning department has not released a preliminary environmental impact summary. No schedule of community input sessions has been posted to the city's public calendar. The conditions attached by the Planning Committee -- which the Tribune reported on at the time -- have not been formally responded to in any document available through the city clerk's office.

This is not unusual for a project of this scale. Environmental reviews take time. But three weeks is not a long time, and a council that just passed two major appropriations in consecutive sessions is about to be asked to approve the most expensive public-private partnership Oakland has ever considered.

The vote math, for now, looks favorable. The four OPP members are expected to support the project. Tran, the District 2 independent, has been described by a source in the council's administrative office as leaning toward approval. Vega remains uncommitted. The three CRC members are expected to oppose. If Tran votes yes, the project passes 5-4 regardless of Vega's position.

But projection and record are different things. The council is being asked to approve a project whose environmental impact has not been publicly summarized. The variable tax exemption structure -- which ties the A's tax obligations to city economic indicators rather than a fixed rate -- has been described in broad terms but not detailed in legislative language available for public review.

Marco Lopez, a forty-year-old mechanic who lives in the Laurel district, has been following the Baylight coverage since the first renderings were released. He drove to City Hall on Tuesday to look for documents in the public records office.

"I found the Planning Committee vote record," Lopez said, leaning against his truck on Oak Street afterward. "I found the rendering packet. I couldn't find anything about the environmental review. The clerk said it might not be posted yet."

The Baylight project has generated significant public interest. Mark Aitken, the A's representative who has expanded the organization's civic engagement over the past several months, confirmed his attendance at the floor vote weeks ago. The franchise has positioned itself as a community partner, with hospital visits, awareness campaigns, and public statements tying the team's success to Oakland's prosperity.

None of that substitutes for a paper trail.

Hector Campbell, a thirty-two-year-old taxi driver in Rockridge, said he supports the stadium project but wants to see the terms.

"I'm not against it," Campbell said. "I drive past the waterfront every day. I'd love to see something built there. But two billion dollars and nobody's published the environmental review? That's a lot of trust to ask for."

The council has three weeks. The environmental review has to be completed, summarized, and made available for public comment before the vote carries the legitimacy that a project of this scale requires. The conditions from the Planning Committee need formal responses. The tax structure needs legislative language.

The Baylight District may very well pass. The votes appear to be there. But a project approved without a complete public record is a project that generates lawsuits, recalls, and regret.

Three weeks. The clock is running.

## BUSINESS TICKER

**By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business**

The commercial corridors were moving this week. Along College Avenue in Rockridge and down through Jack London Square, foot traffic ran heavier than anything I have seen since the holiday stretch, and the reason was not complicated. Summer festival season is here, the tourists showed up, and Oakland's restaurants and bars filled accordingly. In Jack London, the evening crowds have been thick enough to push onto the sidewalks most nights -- the kind of busy that makes a line cook's shift feel like it will never end.

I spoke with Owen Campbell, a bakery worker on the Jack London waterfront, who said he has been pulling extra hours since mid-week. "We are not complaining about the business," Campbell told me. "But I would like to know if this is the new normal or just a summer spike, because my landlord is going to notice either way." That question -- whether the bump is seasonal or structural -- is the one nobody on these corridors can answer yet. Guadalupe Lee, a bartender in Uptown, put it more bluntly: "Every seat has been full since the weather turned. Tips are good. But good tips in July do not pay January rent."

Meanwhile, the West Oakland Stabilization Fund, which passed the council floor vote earlier this summer, has entered its 45-day disbursement window. The city administrator is building an intake framework for corridor investment applications. That money is aimed at anti-displacement measures in West Oakland specifically, and it remains unclear whether workers in adjacent neighborhoods -- the line cooks and janitors and security guards keeping Jack London running through festival season -- will see any downstream benefit. Downtown, the job picture has gotten noticeably worse; several businesses have cut positions in recent weeks, and the people I have talked to on that corridor describe a hiring freeze that feels less like caution and more like retreat. The summer crowds are real. The question, as always, is who they are lifting.

### Oakland Throws a Party While It Waits for a Check

**By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison**

Beverly Hayes was standing behind a folding table on Mandela Parkway on Saturday afternoon, arranging paper plates into stacks of twelve. I asked her what the occasion was.

"Summer Festival," she said. "Same as every year."

I asked if it felt different this year.

She straightened a stack that didn't need straightening. "Everything feels different this year."

She's right. West Oakland is in a strange place this summer. The Stabilization Fund passed -- six votes to three, with Elliott Crane breaking from the CRC coalition to vote yes. Twenty-eight million dollars, earmarked for corridor investment, small business stabilization, and workforce development in a neighborhood that has been asking for exactly this for a decade. The council voted. The mayor signed. The city administrator is building an intake framework. And the 45-day disbursement clock is running.

But the money hasn't arrived yet.

So here was West Oakland on Saturday, throwing its Summer Festival under overcast skies, celebrating a victory that is still, technically, a promise. I watched a man in a Warriors jersey carry a speaker the size of a suitcase down 7th Street, trailing bass behind him like a wake. Kids chased each other through the crowd. A woman was selling elote from a cart near the corner, steam rising off the grill into the gray afternoon air.

Calvin Turner, 38, a mechanic from Fruitvale, had driven over for the day. He was sitting on a low wall near the food vendors, eating a plate of rice and beans.

"I came because my cousin lives here," he said. "She told me, 'Come see what we got.' And what she meant was, come see what we might get."

That distinction -- what we got versus what we might get -- sat underneath everything on Saturday. Acts Full Gospel Church held its Summer Festival sermon that morning, and the congregation addressed community concerns directly. The seniors lunch program at Acts Full Gospel marked a milestone: it has been operating continuously now through four seasons, feeding between forty and sixty seniors every week, and the congregation made a point of celebrating that at the festival. But the sermon, people told me afterward, was as much about patience as gratitude.

I walked south toward the commercial strip. A hand-lettered banner hung between two poles: WEST OAKLAND SUMMER FESTIVAL 2041. Underneath someone had taped a printed sign: STABILIZATION FUND -- PASSED. No exclamation point. Just the word.

Hayes caught up with me near the end of the afternoon. She had been running between tables for six hours. I asked her what she wanted people to take away from the day.

"That we're still here," she said. "That we showed up before the money and we'll show up after. The fund is real. The vote was real. But this" -- she gestured at the thinning crowd, a kid on a bicycle weaving between folding chairs -- "this was real before any of that."

Elena Rivera, the West Oakland civic leader who had championed the fund through committee, was not at the festival. Several neighbors told me she had been in meetings all week with the city administrator's office, working through implementation details. Her absence was noted but not criticized. "She's doing the work," one vendor said. "That's what we asked for."

By six o'clock the overcast had thickened but the crowd hadn't entirely thinned. A group of teenagers had taken over the speaker and were playing music I didn't recognize. The elote cart was out of corn. The banner still hung between its poles, swaying slightly.

West Oakland is celebrating. It is also waiting. These are not contradictory things. This is what it looks like when a neighborhood that has been promised things before gets promised something again, and this time the vote actually went through, and the paperwork is actually being filed, and the 45-day clock is actually ticking.

They threw a party anyway. That's Oakland.

### The Quiet Work Behind the Festival Banners

**By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison**

While Oakland was hanging Summer Festival banners last week, St. Columba Catholic Church in Fruitvale activated its emergency assistance fund.

The timing tells a story this city knows by heart. The celebration is real. The need is also real. They happen on the same block, sometimes in the same building.

I visited St. Columba on Friday morning. The parish office was busy in a way that had nothing to do with festival preparation. A special sermon earlier in the week had addressed community concerns -- the kinds of concerns that don't make festival programs. The emergency fund, which provides direct financial assistance to families in acute need, was activated. A woman at the reception desk told me they had seen steady traffic since Wednesday.

Rafael Phillips, 26, a server who lives in Fruitvale, was waiting outside the parish hall.

"My tia told me to come here," he said. "She said they help with electric bills. I don't know if that's true but I'm here."

I told him I didn't know the specifics of the fund. He nodded. "That's the thing. Nobody knows the specifics of anything right now. The Stabilization Fund passed, everybody's happy, but my electric bill is due Thursday."

Across town in Temescal, the Islamic Center of Oakland organized a community grief gathering. The details were private -- grief gatherings are not press conferences -- but the fact of it sat alongside the center's other activity this week: a guest speaker visiting the congregation, regular programming continuing. The grief gathering drew neighbors from outside the mosque's usual membership, according to a man I spoke with near the entrance.

Andre Lee, 55, an electrician from Temescal, was leaving the Islamic Center after the gathering.

"I'm not Muslim," he said. "I'm not anything, really. But my neighbor's kid passed, and when they said the center was holding space, I went. You go."

That kind of crossing -- a non-member walking into a faith space because the need was there -- is happening at scale right now. Allen Temple Baptist Church in East Oakland hosted a community health fair. Cathedral of Christ the Light at Lake Merritt ran its food pantry and a choir performance on the same day. Lake Merritt United Methodist in Adams Point held a choir service. First Presbyterian Church Downtown held a choir performance. Temple Sinai in Rockridge drew its regular faithful. East Bay Meditation Center Downtown observed Obon, the Japanese Buddhist festival honoring ancestors. Masjid Al-Islam in East Oakland welcomed a guest speaker and organized a neighborhood cleanup. Kehilla Community Synagogue in Grand Lake hosted a guest speaker. First Unitarian Church on Lake Merritt served its food pantry. Shiva Vishnu Temple in Montclair held a choir service.

More than twenty events across more than a dozen congregations in a single week. Food pantries, health fairs, emergency funds, guest speakers, grief gatherings, cleanup crews, choir performances.

Marco Johnson, 33, a nurse aide from Adams Point, volunteers at the Cathedral of Christ the Light food pantry on alternating weeks.

"People ask me why the pantry's busy when the city's doing well," he said. "I tell them, 'Doing well' is an average. Averages don't feed anybody."

Gallery Owner Mei Chen, who operates out of Laurel, has been documenting faith community work across Oakland -- photographing food pantry lines, choir rehearsals, volunteer shifts. She told the Tribune earlier this spring that she saw the faith community as Oakland's true infrastructure, the part that doesn't wait for council votes or funding timelines.

The interfaith council met downtown this week, coordinating across traditions. The details of that meeting were not public, but the fact of the meeting -- representatives from Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, and Hindu congregations sitting in the same room -- is itself worth noting. When Oakland's faith leaders coordinate, it usually means they're seeing the same pressures from different angles.

Acts Full Gospel Church in West Oakland, in addition to its Summer Festival sermon, marked a milestone for its seniors lunch program. The program has run continuously through what has been, by any measure, a complicated year. It is the kind of achievement that doesn't make headlines -- steady, quiet, ongoing. The opposite of a festival.

But it is the work that holds the city together while the banners go up and come down.

### The Summer the Volume Went Up

**By Kai Marston | Arts & Entertainment**

Uptown on Saturday night was the loudest I have heard it since last October's First Friday. Sound came from everywhere -- from open doorways on Telegraph, from a car idling at the curb with its windows down, from a drummer sitting on an overturned bucket near 19th Street with a crowd of eight watching him work.

It is Summer Festival weekend, and Oakland's arts district is running hot.

Sculptor Alma Vasquez has a new piece installed in KONO -- I saw it from the sidewalk, visible through a storefront window, a welded steel figure about four feet tall with its arms raised. Vasquez has been working in KONO for years, and her pieces have become landmarks of a district that keeps arguing about what it wants to be. This one felt right for the moment: arms up, reaching for something, not quite touching it.

Down the block, Muralist Dante Reyes was finishing a wall. The mural was half-done when I walked by around seven o'clock, and Reyes was up on a ladder with a roller, working fast. He had maybe two hours of good light left, overcast or not. A couple stopped to take a photo. Reyes didn't look down.

I headed to Jack London, where the evening crowd was already thick by eight. The district has been surging this summer -- the busiest stretch of nightlife Oakland has seen in months. Jalen Hill, 35, a line cook at one of the waterfront spots, was on a smoke break out back when I passed through.

"We've been slammed since Memorial Day," he said. "I'm not complaining. When it's slow, they cut hours. When it's busy, I eat."

His coworker Marcus Walker, 48, a dishwasher who has worked Jack London for over a decade, came outside to join him.

"Every summer they say it's going to be the big one," Walker said. "The summer everything changes. I've been hearing that since I started. What I notice is the plates keep coming."

That grounded skepticism runs through Jack London's service industry like rebar. The district looks good right now -- foot traffic is heavy, the restaurants are full, the bars have lines. But the people pouring drinks and scrubbing pots know that a good summer doesn't mean the fall will follow.

Still, you could feel the pull. Jade Orion, the Temescal musician, has been booking shows across the East Bay, and word in the district is that she played a private set in Jack London earlier this week. Theo Banks, the Piedmont Ave rapper, has been spotted at open mics on Telegraph. Lena Cross, the Uptown arts figure, was seen at a gallery opening on Saturday -- her presence alone draws a certain crowd, the kind that stands in clusters and talks with their hands.

Rico Valez, also out of Uptown, posted a photo from what looked like a warehouse studio, paint on his forearms, with a caption about summer deadlines. Marin Tao, the Piedmont Ave artist who remains the most recognized creative figure in Oakland, was not at any public event this weekend, but that absence is its own kind of presence -- when Tao doesn't show up, people mention it.

Lake Merritt was packed on Sunday afternoon. Families on blankets, joggers on the path, the usual drum circle near the amphitheater pulling a crowd of maybe thirty. The overcast skies kept the temperature down, which kept people out longer. I watched a man set up an easel near the boathouse and start painting the lake itself -- the gray water, the gray sky, the green fringe of trees.

Mateo Walker, 47, a delivery driver from Jack London, was sitting on a bench near the lake with his daughter.

"She wanted to come see the water," he said. "I wanted to sit down. Everybody wins."

I asked him if he'd been to any of the festival events.

"Nah," he said. "This is my festival. Right here."

That might be the truest thing I heard all weekend. Oakland's Summer Festival is partly organized events and banners and speeches, and partly just this: people outside, being near each other, the volume turned up because the sun stays out late and the city has things to say.

The art scene is flourishing. The nightlife is surging. The restaurants are full. Whether any of this means something durable -- whether the Stabilization Fund money will land, whether the corridor investments will materialize, whether the line cooks will still have hours in October -- nobody at the lake on Sunday was willing to say.

But the volume was up. And for now, Oakland was listening to itself.

## THE WHOLE TOWN SHOWED UP AND NOBODY HAD TO ASK THEM TO

**By P Slayer | Fan Column**

I was standing outside Bushrod Park on Saturday afternoon, watching Danny Horn throw underhand to a line of eight-year-olds in mismatched jerseys, and I had this thought that I couldn't shake: nobody organized this feeling. Nobody put out a press release about it. It just happened.

Horn ran his wiffleball tournament in Temescal this week. He set up on the grass at Bushrod Park, pulled out a bucket of plastic balls, and let the neighborhood come to him. And they did.

Vinnie Keane was there. Not waving from a VIP tent. Standing at the edge of the infield in a pair of basketball shorts and sandals, his wife Amara next to him holding two waters and a program from the Temescal community vote earlier that day. Keane, who is about to play his final season in green and gold, who will be honored as part of the 2041 dynasty celebration, was watching a kid swing a yellow bat at a plastic ball and miss by about three feet, and he was laughing. Not performing. Laughing.

Ernesto Quintero was shagging flies. Deacon Seymour was keeping score on a clipboard. Mike Paulson -- Mike Paulson, the man half of Oakland is still deciding whether to forgive -- was sitting in a folding chair behind the backstop talking to a woman about parking.

Oakland, do you understand what I'm telling you?

I walked over to the taco stand on the first-base side and ran into Calvin Turner, a mechanic from Fruitvale who's been coming to these things since the first one. He had grease under his fingernails and a Danny Horn shirsey that had seen better days. "I brought my nephew," Turner told me. "He doesn't care about the A's yet. Give him one afternoon with Horn and he will."

That's the thing. That's the whole thing.

Across the bay, the Warriors are 31-24 and riding a five-game win streak since Giannis Antetokounmpo showed up in blue and gold. Steph Curry just got named the All-Star starter at point guard -- again -- and Jimmy Butler made it as a reserve. Chase Center is electric right now. I know because I was there Tuesday and the building was vibrating before tip-off.

And here, in Temescal, Danny Horn was teaching a kid how to grip a two-seam fastball with a wiffleball.

I don't want to make this bigger than it is. I also don't want to make it smaller. Because the thing about Oakland is that we have spent years begging our teams to care about us. We have sat in parking lots and bars and living rooms and asked the basic question: do you see us? And for stretches -- long, brutal, grinding stretches -- the answer was silence.

Not right now.

Right now, Keane is spending his last off-season in Montclair, walking to the coffee shop on Moraga Avenue, and telling anyone who asks that he wouldn't have played anywhere else. Right now, Seymour is preparing for his first spring training as manager and he's doing it by showing up to a wiffleball game in Temescal with a clipboard and a whistle. Right now, Paulson is sitting in a folding chair behind a backstop in a public park, and whatever you think about his three-day-a-week Mesa schedule or the Warriors front office whispering his name, the man was there on Saturday. In Oakland. On the ground.

Rafael Phillips, a server from Fruitvale, was watching from the bleachers with a couple of friends. "I don't need Paulson to promise me anything," he said. "I need him to keep showing up like this. That's it. That's the whole speech."

I don't know if this lasts. I never do. This city has taught me not to trust the good stretches because the bad ones always come with sharper teeth. But I know what I saw on Saturday in Temescal: a starting pitcher throwing underhanded to children. A legend in sandals. A general manager in a folding chair. A rookie manager keeping score.

Nobody had to ask them. They just showed up.

And if that doesn't mean something to you, I don't know what would.

## WARRIORS HIT ALL-STAR BREAK ON A STREAK, BUT THE REAL TEST STARTS AFTER

**By Anthony | Beat Report**

The Warriors will send two players to All-Star Weekend with a 31-24 record and five consecutive wins, and if you had told the Chase Center front office that sentence would be true in February, most of them would have asked you to repeat the part about Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Steph Curry earned the starting nod at point guard. Jimmy Butler was named a reserve. The two selections mark the first time since the dynasty core was intact that Golden State has placed multiple names on the All-Star roster, and the timing is not coincidental. The Warriors have won every game since Antetokounmpo arrived from Milwaukee in the three-team deal that sent Draymond Green to Boston and Moses Moody with four first-round picks to the Bucks. Five games is not a trend. But five games without a loss, with a new seven-footer still learning the playbook, is not nothing, either.

The question that Chase Center is not yet asking out loud -- but that the numbers will eventually force -- is what this team looks like when the win streak breaks. Because it will break. Integration has a cost, and the cost is usually measured in late-game possessions where the new player and the old system speak different languages. Curry and Antetokounmpo have not yet faced a team that game-plans specifically against their partnership. The postseason will be full of those teams.

For now, the evidence is encouraging. The Warriors are a half-game out of the four seed in the Western Conference. Curry has looked revitalized -- more off-ball movement, more willingness to let Butler initiate from the wing, and a visible trust in Antetokounmpo's ability to find him cutting through traffic. Butler, for his part, has settled into a secondary creation role that would have been unthinkable for him three years ago but fits the current roster construction.

Meanwhile, the front office question that will not go away: the Warriors' confirmed interest in Mike Paulson. The A's general manager has not commented. His representatives have not commented. The Warriors have offered no further statement beyond the initial confirmation. Paulson was in Oakland on Saturday, at Danny Horn's wiffleball tournament in Temescal, sitting in a folding chair behind the backstop. He was not at Chase Center. He was not meeting with Warriors ownership. He was watching children swing plastic bats.

That could mean everything. That could mean nothing. The Paulson situation has been frozen in the same posture for weeks -- confirmed interest, no comment, no movement -- and at some point the silence itself becomes the story. Either the Warriors are waiting for Paulson to signal availability, or Paulson has already signaled that he is not available and the Warriors have not accepted it. Neither side has clarified.

What is clear: the on-court product does not need Paulson to function. The five-game win streak belongs to the players and the coaching staff. Curry's All-Star selection belongs to Curry. Butler's reserve nod belongs to Butler. The Giannis trade was engineered by the existing front office, not by a hypothetical future executive.

The All-Star break arrives at a useful moment. The Warriors get time to integrate. They get time to plan for the second half. And they get to exhale, briefly, at 31-24 -- a record that looked unlikely in November and looks like a starting point now.

Spring training opens soon for the A's, where Paulson will presumably be present for at least part of the Cactus League schedule. Deacon Seymour will be running his first camp. Vinnie Keane will be suiting up for the last time. And Danny Horn will be transitioning from wiffleball in Temescal back to two-seam fastballs in Mesa.

The break is the break. What comes after will determine whether the streak was a beginning or a peak.

## THE LAST SUMMER IN GREEN AND GOLD

**By Hal Richmond | Senior Historian**

You learn, if you do this long enough, that farewell seasons have a particular weight to them. They press down on everything. The at-bats carry more. The walks to the plate carry more. Even the off-days carry more, because there are fewer of them left, and everyone in the ballpark knows the count.

I have covered Oakland baseball for forty-four years. I was there for the Bash Brothers. I was there for Moneyball. I was there for the wilderness decades when the Coliseum felt like a mausoleum with a scoreboard. And I was there for the dynasty that Vinnie Keane helped build -- the one they are going to celebrate during the 2041 season, with a ceremony, with returning players, with the whole apparatus of institutional memory that franchises deploy when they want to remind a city what winning felt like.

Keane does not need a ceremony to be remembered. But the franchise needs the ceremony. Oakland needs it.

I saw Keane on Saturday at Danny Horn's wiffleball tournament in Temescal. He was standing near the third-base line in basketball shorts and sandals. His wife Amara was next to him, holding a program from the Temescal community vote that had happened earlier in the day. She was talking to someone about parking. He was watching a child swing a yellow bat and miss.

There was nothing performative about it. That is the detail that matters. Because I have watched athletes do the farewell circuit for decades, and most of them treat it like a press tour. The retirement announcement is staged. The final games are choreographed. The emotion is real but curated -- presented for cameras, packaged for highlight reels, delivered in soundbites that sound good in montages.

Keane is not doing that. Keane is standing in a public park in Temescal watching children play wiffleball and laughing at a kid who swung and missed by a full foot.

Mark Aitken was at the Temescal vote earlier that day. This is what Aitken does now -- he shows up to community proceedings the way other players show up to endorsement dinners. He sits in the gallery. He listens. He has become the kind of citizen-athlete that Oakland has always wanted but rarely gotten. When the Baylight District vote comes before the council, Aitken's presence in those rooms will be part of the record, whether he says a word or not.

But this piece is about Keane. About what it means to watch a man play his last summer in the only uniform he has ever worn.

The dynasty celebration will bring back familiar names. Benji Dillon, who anchored the rotation. Danny Horn, who is still here, still throwing, still sponsoring wiffleball tournaments in neighborhoods that need them. The roster from those championship years was deep and talented, but Keane was its emotional center -- the second baseman who played every inning of every October game, who never asked out of the lineup, who once told me in the press box at the Coliseum that he measured seasons not by statistics but by whether the clubhouse felt right.

I think about that now, in the context of Deacon Seymour's first season as manager. Seymour is young. Seymour has not yet managed a game that counts. But Seymour will have Vinnie Keane in his clubhouse for one season -- one last season -- and if he is smart, he will let Keane set the temperature the way Keane has always set the temperature: quietly, through presence, through consistency, through showing up.

Mike Paulson was at the wiffleball tournament too. Sitting in a folding chair behind the backstop. The Warriors want him. The A's need him. He has not said a public word about any of it. The silence is conspicuous. But on Saturday, he was in Temescal, and that is worth noting even if it explains nothing.

The farewell season has not started yet. Spring training is still ahead. The 2041 schedule has not been printed. But the farewell has already begun, in the way that endings always begin -- not with an announcement but with a feeling. The feeling that this is the last time. The last summer. The last walk to the plate in green and gold.

I have watched this franchise for forty-four years. I have seen stars leave, some bitterly, some gracefully, some in trades that made the back page and broke the city's heart. Vinnie Keane is going to leave the way he played: without drama, without spectacle, on his own terms, in his own time.

Oakland has always been a city that respects people who stay. Vinnie Keane stayed.

Names Index: Vinnie Keane (As Legend/2B), Amara Keane (Vinnie Keane's wife), Danny Horn (A's SP), Mark Aitken (A's 3B/As Legend), Deacon Seymour (A's Manager), Benji Dillon (A's SP), Mike Paulson (A's GM)

## Josh Giddey Dropped 34-10-17 and the League Still Doesn't Know His Name

*By Selena Grant*

Let me give you the stat line first, because it deserves to sit there by itself for a moment: 34 points, 10 rebounds, 17 assists. That is what Josh Giddey did to the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night at the United Center. He outplayed Nikola Jokic. He orchestrated a 108-100 victory that pushed the Bulls to 39-16. He recorded the kind of triple-double that, in any other city, on any other roster, would have been the lead story on every sports broadcast in the country.

And then the All-Star voting came out, and Josh Giddey was eighth in backcourt voting with 1.6 million votes. Eighth. Not a starter. Not a reserve. An afterthought.

I want to be clear about what the numbers say about Giddey's season: 18.7 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists per game. On a team with the best record in the Eastern Conference. On a roster that Mike Paulson assembled from parts nobody else wanted and trades nobody else would have made. Giddey has been the engine of a team that is now, by any reasonable measure, a legitimate title contender -- and the league's voters looked at the best record in the East, looked at the point guard running it, and decided he was the eighth-most-interesting backcourt player in the conference.

Here is what that tells you: the national media still does not take the Bulls seriously.

They should. Walker Kessler added 25 points and 7 rebounds against Denver. Hank Trepagnier -- who leads the Rookie of the Year conversation at 16.9 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists per game -- put up 27 points, 10 rebounds, and 3 blocks. Trepagnier has been named the starting center for the World team in Friday night's Rising Stars game. Adash Stanley will come off the bench as the sixth man. Two Bulls rookies in the showcase game. That does not happen by accident. That happens because Paulson drafted with conviction and head coach Billy Donovan developed with patience.

Although Donovan's patience has its limits. After the Nuggets win, Donovan called out Trepagnier publicly -- not for his play, but for celebrating and failing to get back in transition. Multiple times. The critique landed with the specificity of a coach who believes in his player enough to hold him accountable in front of cameras. Trepagnier is twenty years old and playing like an All-Star. Donovan wants to make sure he plays like a professional first.

The other significant news from the week: Ayo Dosunmu has re-signed on a three-year, $16.88 million deal. That is Paulson's front office at work -- locking in a proven rotation guard at a reasonable number while the rest of the league overpays for lesser talent. Dosunmu is not flashy. He will never lead the All-Star vote. But he is the kind of player who makes a roster deep enough to survive the playoffs, and Paulson paid exactly what depth is worth.

The uncomfortable subtext remains. Paulson is still splitting his time -- three days in Mesa with the Warriors front office, three days in Chicago, available by phone seven days a week. The Warriors' interest in him is confirmed. Paulson has offered no comment. The Bulls are 39-16, their general manager has one foot in another city, and the league is still pretending Josh Giddey is the eighth-best guard in the East.

Sooner or later, one of those things has to give.

Names Index: Josh Giddey (PG, Bulls), Hank Trepagnier (C/Rookie, Bulls), Walker Kessler (C, Bulls), Adash Stanley (Rookie, Bulls), Ayo Dosunmu (G, Bulls), Mike Paulson (GM, Bulls/Warriors), Billy Donovan (Head Coach, Bulls), Nikola Jokic (referenced opponent)

CHICAGO GROUND

## Three Days a Week

*By Talia Finch*

The ceiling fan at Nino's on Halsted was doing its best against eighty-four degrees on Thursday afternoon, which is to say it was losing. The windows were open. The overcast sky sat on Bridgeport like a lid. I could hear a woman two booths over explaining the Paulson situation to someone who clearly had not been following it.

"He's here three days," she said. "Then he flies to Arizona. Then he flies back. Then he flies to Arizona again."

A pause. "That's a lot of flying."

"That's what I'm saying."

The man she was talking to set his coffee down. His name was Omar Clark, 27, a line cook who lives in Pilsen. He was off shift, still in his work blacks, scrolling through Bulls highlights on his phone with his thumb. He had the Giddey triple-double pulled up -- 34 points, 17 assists -- frozen on a screenshot.

"I keep looking at it," he said, when I asked. "I keep thinking, this is real. This is happening here. And then I think about Paulson leaving and I put my phone down."

He didn't put his phone down. He swiped to the next clip.

Down the block from Nino's, a flyer taped to a light pole announced a youth basketball clinic at McGuane Park this weekend. No sponsor listed. No Bulls logo. Just a phone number and the words FREE CLINIC -- ALL AGES. Someone had written in marker underneath: *Trepagnier better show up*.

I doubt he will. Trepagnier is headed to the Rising Stars game. But the impulse is the thing -- the assumption that the Bulls belong to the neighborhood now, that the players owe something to the blocks that adopted them. A year ago, nobody in Bridgeport was writing Hank Trepagnier's name on anything.

At the counter, a man named Damien Roberts, 31, a line cook from Bronzeville, was eating a sandwich and watching the television above the register. SportsCenter was on. The volume was low but the closed captions were running.

"You know what gets me?" he said to no one in particular. "Giddey's eighth. Eighth. The man had seventeen assists last night and he's eighth."

He shook his head. Took another bite.

"Paulson's here three days a week and the team's got the best record in the East," he said. "Imagine if he was here seven."

I heard that sentence -- or some version of it -- three times on Thursday. At Nino's. At the park. Walking past the barbershop on Morgan Street where a man was sweeping the sidewalk and listening to the game recap through a speaker propped in the doorway. Everyone has the same math: if three days produces 39-16, what would full commitment look like? And underneath that math, the question nobody wants to say out loud: what if three days is all they're ever going to get?

The ceiling fan kept turning. The coffee was still hot. The flyer on the light pole was already curling at the edges in the humidity.

Names Index: Omar Clark (Line Cook, Pilsen), Damien Roberts (Line Cook, Bronzeville), Mike Paulson (GM, Bulls/Warriors), Josh Giddey (PG, Bulls), Hank Trepagnier (C/Rookie, Bulls)

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

Dear Editor,

They keep telling me to celebrate. The fund passed. Six to three. Even Crane crossed over, which I admit I did not see coming. Fine. I will give them that.

But I have been in West Oakland since 1986. I watched the Washingtons get pushed out of Peralta Street. That house is boarded up now. Nobody celebrated for them. I watched the Lees leave, the Franklins leave. Every time somebody passes something at city hall, the rest of us are supposed to feel saved.

Forty-five days, they say. Forty-five days to start sending money out. I am on a fixed income. My landlord is not on a fixed timeline. He already called twice in June talking about "market adjustments." I know what that means.

I am not against this fund. I voted for the people who pushed it. But I have been promised things before. I will believe it when the check doesn't bounce.

-- Gloria Hutchins, 68, West Oakland

Dear Editor,

I just need everybody to understand what it was like at La Estrella on International on Tuesday night. The game was already on, the place was already packed, and then somebody's phone went off and the whole bar just lost it. Giannis. To the Warriors. People were standing on chairs. My cousin knocked a whole pitcher of horchata off the table and nobody even cared.

I am nineteen years old. I grew up watching this team lose. I was twelve the last time anybody in my family even wanted to talk about the Warriors. And now you're telling me Giannis Antetokounmpo is going to put on a Warriors jersey? In Oakland?

I know we lost Draymond in the deal. I know people are upset about that. But I am sorry, I cannot be sad right now. I walked home from that bar and the whole avenue was buzzing. Strangers high-fiving each other. This is what sports is supposed to feel like.

-- DeShawn Avery, 19, Fruitvale

Dear Editor,

I take Mrs. Amara to the Telegraph clinic three times a week. I have sat in that waiting room so many times I can tell you what page the Sports Illustrated is dog-eared to. It is page forty-seven, and that magazine is from 2024.

The clinic is good. The people who work there are doing their best. But it is packed. Every single day it is packed. And lately it has been worse. More people coming in with summer bugs, heat complaints, kids with rashes. I see the nurses' faces. They are running on empty.

So when I heard the health center appropriation passed for Temescal, I sat in my car for a minute and just breathed. I know it will take time to build. I know we will not see a new building tomorrow. But for the first time in a long while, somebody looked at this neighborhood and said yes, these people need help, and then actually voted to give it.

I will keep driving Mrs. Amara to Telegraph until the new place opens. But it is nice to know there is a finish line now.

-- Patricia Nolan, 55, Temescal

Dear Editor,

My wife Ruth and I saw Vinnie Keane's first game. Section 215, row F. She picked those seats because she liked being high enough to see the whole diamond. She kept score in a little spiral notebook, the kind you get at the drugstore for a dollar. I still have every one of them.

Now they are saying this is his last season. The farewell tour. They are planning a celebration for the whole dynasty, Keane and Dillon and all of them. And I am glad they are doing it. Those boys earned it. Keane especially. He stayed when everybody else was talking about leaving.

But I will be honest with you. I am going to have a hard time sitting in that section without Ruth. She passed in the spring of '39. I have gone to a few games since then but it is not the same. You do not realize how much of baseball is the person next to you until that seat is empty.

I will be there for Vinnie's last game, though. I owe him that. Ruth would have insisted.

-- Clarence Moody, 72, Montclair
