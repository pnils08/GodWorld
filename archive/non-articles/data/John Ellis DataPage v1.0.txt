Scouting Summary:
John Ellis enters the majors as a polished right-hander with advanced command and a balanced
four-pitch mix. His 99 arm strength anchors a clean, repeatable delivery. Projected mid-rotation
potential with a chance to develop into a high-strikeout, low-walk innings-eater reminiscent of a young
Benji Dillon.
