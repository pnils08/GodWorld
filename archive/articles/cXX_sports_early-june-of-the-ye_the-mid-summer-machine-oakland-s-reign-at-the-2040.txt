The Mid-Summer Machine: Oakland’s Reign at the 2040 Break
(By Hal Richmond, Bay Tribune Archives — The Richmond Archive Collection)
The Table
By early June of the year twenty-forty, the table had already begun to tilt toward Oakland. Forty-two wins, twenty losses, a club batting average that felt like sunlight on steel. The West had teeth that year — Texas striking quick, Houston still humming from old pride — but the Athletics looked less like a team and more like an orbit. Every game circled a rhythm. You could feel it in the way the outfield moved before the pitch, as if they knew where the ball would land before the swing even came.
The Race
Awards talk comes early now. The modern press loves its race boards and leader lines. Back then, Mark Aitken had seventeen home runs before the heat of summer and was already chasing his own heartbeat. Darrin Davis, older now but stubbornly brilliant, matched him blow for blow. Benji Dillon, eight wins and two losses at that point, sat quiet in the dugout, the look of a man who understood what patience could earn. Even young Vladimir Gonzalez — before the fracture, before the silence — hit over three-hundred and thirty. The crowd could sense the making of something not new, but continued — another season added to the long line of winning years.
The Men
By the break, sixty-seven wins, thirty-one losses. Danny Horn was not just an All-Star — he was the league’s leading vote-getter, a crown given by the people who filled the stands. Davis made his eighth appearance, the body slower but the swing more deliberate. Arturo Ramos, only a year removed from his Rookie of the Year, stood shoulder to shoulder with veterans twice his age. And Mark Aitken, with the quiet confidence of an engineer at work, walked into the Home Run Derby and built a masterpiece. Fourteen home runs in the first round, twenty-two in the second, sixteen in the final. He did not celebrate; he simply nodded, as if confirming a calculation.
The Machine
Oakland led the league in power, second in contact, first in pitching, somewhere mid-pack in defense — and none of it seemed to matter. The machine turned. Dillon threw his twelve wins by muscle memory. Martin Richards flirted with a batting title. John Ellis, the rookie, pitched like he had seen these lights before. Behind them, Mike Kinder, calm as ever, wrote lineups that read like scripture: Horn leading, Davis driving, Aitken anchoring. They were less a team and more a memory of what dominance once looked like — methodical, merciful, unstoppable.
The Moment Before the Fall Classic
Every dynasty has a hum, a sound you hear before the lights dim. In twenty-forty, that sound was joy wrapped in inevitability. The Athletics were again first in the West, first in the league, first in the quiet confidence that comes from legacy. Gonzalez’s injury lingered like a warning, but even absence became part of the rhythm. As July bent into August, the city stood still in its own reflection — knowing that autumn would bring another run, another October where the green and gold would walk toward the storm, unafraid.
