Why East Oakland Feels Connected to This Team Again

You can measure a baseball season a hundred different ways — in standings, in WAR calculations, in playoff odds that shift with every series. But the way a city feels about its team can’t be plotted on any of those charts. And nowhere is that more true than in East Oakland, where connection isn’t given easily, and when it returns, it means something real.

For a long stretch, the bond between the A’s and the neighborhoods east of the Lake felt stretched thin. Not broken — just quiet. People still watched, still talked, still cared, but the spark wasn’t the same. The franchise kept changing. The future kept feeling uncertain. And in communities where day-to-day life already asks a lot, emotional energy isn’t spent lightly.

But lately, something small and steady has been happening again — the kind of shift you notice only if you know what these streets sound like when baseball matters. It starts at the bus stops along Foothill, where older fans wear A’s hats that are more faded than anything on the field. It shows up at street vendors near 73rd, where the talk between orders starts drifting back toward who’s hitting well and who looks ready for a call-up. It’s in the fathers and uncles coaching youth teams at Tassafaronga, invoking names like Keane and Kelley as if they still shape the city’s heartbeat.

This team feels different to East Oakland because it feels familiar — not in personnel, but in attitude. They work. They compete. They don’t flinch in tense innings. They don’t apologize for winning. There’s something about that combination that resonates with communities used to pushing through, to making something out of what others underestimate.

And then there’s Ernesto Quintero. Not a star, not yet, but the type of player who makes neighborhoods lean in. Young. Hungry. Rough around the edges in all the right ways. A worker more than a headline. These are the types of players East Oakland has always claimed even before the rest of the league sees their value. Not for the stats — for the truth in the effort.

People don’t say it out loud, but you can feel it — the city wants to believe again. Not because of marketing campaigns or stadium politics, but because the baseball on the field looks like the kind of baseball East Oakland respects: earned, not gifted.

Connection doesn’t return all at once. It returns moment by moment. Swing by swing. Night by night. And lately, the nights have felt like they belong to this city again.
