# GodWorld — Rollout Plan

**This file is canonical for open/closed work** (S207). Pointer-only: one line per job, detail lives in the pointer doc — never here (S286 hard rule, Mike-direct).

**Status:** ACTIVE (building) | **Last Updated:** Session 286 (2026-07-02) — pointer-collapse: all inline row detail relocated verbatim to owning plan docs; pre-collapse file in git history + section moves in [[ROLLOUT_ARCHIVE]].
**Filing protocol (S212):** semantic groups + pointer-only entries — see [[rollout-rules]] §3–§5 (taxonomy, add, close). Full design: [[../adr/0005-rollout-plan-structure]].
**North star:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE_VISION.md` — Jarvis + persistent sessions. Everything we build points there.
**Completed phase details:** [[engine/ROLLOUT_ARCHIVE]] — read on demand, not at boot.
**Research context:** `docs/RESEARCH.md` — findings log, evaluations, sources.
**Wiki layer:** [[SCHEMA]] (conventions) + [[index]] (catalog) — read at boot. (Phase 41.1 + 41.2, S146.)
**Plan-file contract:** [[plans/TEMPLATE]] — every new plan copies this shape (S152). Also referenced from [[rollout-rules]] §4.
**Phase backlog:** [[plans/BACKLOG]] — designs catalogued but not yet scheduled. Promote to its own plan file when a session picks one up.
**Terminal owners:** `engine-sheet` / `media` / `civic` / `research-build`. Research-build owns this doc; engine-sheet executes engine code; media runs editions; civic runs city-hall.

---

## Rules & conventions → [[rollout-rules]]

**The operating doctrine for this tracker lives in [[rollout-rules]].** State labels, group taxonomy, how to add/close work, filing, archiving, and the sweep code — one doctrine, every terminal follows it. Read it before adding or closing a row.

**Before you log an issue here:** rollout is the clean shared map. Skill terminals (civic/media) log issues in their per-cycle production gap log (that's the research layer) — **not** as raw rollout rows. A row only appears here when work is *promoted* to tracked, and it points at the gap log rather than reproducing it. Full rule: [[rollout-rules]] §2.

Rationale + alternatives: [[../adr/0005-rollout-plan-structure]]. The completed S145 10-step **Spine** roadmap is archived in [[ROLLOUT_ARCHIVE]].

---

## Open Work — by group

Per ADR-0005: each entry codes as `<group>.<n>`. State per [[rollout-rules]] §3. Description lives in pointer doc, NOT in the row. Heavy-skill gap logs (civic + media generator terminals) follow [[../plans/GAP_LOG_TEMPLATE]].

## Watch List

Tracking for future adoption. Not building.

| Feature | Trigger to Act |
|---------|---------------|
| **Drive OAuth Production-token longevity** (governance.41 ES-1) | Token minted 2026-06-20; if it **dies on/before 2026-06-27**, the In-production mint did NOT cure the expiry → reopen as NEW triage (root cause was mint-time expiry policy carried by Testing-era tokens; re-mint is the workaround that already failed once). If it survives past 2026-06-27, permanent fix confirmed → drop this row. |

| Lightpanda Browser | Beta stabilizes, saves 300MB RAM |
| Claude Code Voice Mode | Maturity improves |
| Extended Thinking for Agents | Test on civic/sports desks |
| Computer Use exits beta | Stable + cheaper → expand beyond QA to routine agent tasks |

| Codex Plugin (`/codex:adversarial-review`) | Mike keeps ChatGPT sub → install plugin for free adversarial code review. Sub cancelled → skip. Source: S131 |
| Open-source agent harnesses | Stable harness with MCP + skills + hooks support → re-evaluate Phase 21 as real multi-model pipeline. Track: Claw Code (instructkr/claw-code), community forks. Source: S131 |
| xMemory (hierarchical memory) | AutoDream fails to solve collapsed retrieval after 5 sessions → evaluate self-hosted xMemory |

| **`--print` honors agent `tools:` / `disallowedTools:` frontmatter** (claude-code 2.1.119) | Sandcastle+Daytona reviewer hosting goes operational — per-agent tool restrictions ride along into the sandbox. Strengthens Phase 40.6 Layer 4 (tool gate). Source: S177 |

Deep-learning document parser. Data connectors for Google Drive, Confluence, S3, Notion, Discord. Apache 2.0, Docker-based. github.com/infiniflow/ragflow. Source: S142 |
| **Adobe Creative Cloud connector** (Anthropic Apr 28 2026) | Returning to FLUX text-suppression ceiling research (`docs/RESEARCH.md §S197`) — 5th intervention path: generate base scenes in FLUX, post-process failure modes (gibberish placards, real-brand logos, wrong jersey numbers) in Photoshop via Claude instead of regenerating. Addresses the S196 mesa case (3 regens, 3 different failure modes). Source: S207 tech reading. |
| **Outside-vendor image swap** (GPT Image 2 / Ideogram 3 — [[../research/2026-06-16-flux-image-model-eval]], verdict `watch`) | engine.37 (FLUX.2 pro bump) ships and STILL misses one axis on real specs → run a one-cycle two-axis bake-off (text-suppression AND named-subject fidelity) vs GPT Image 2 + Ideogram 3 on the standing fixture (mesa / baylight / transit_hub + an Isley-class named subject). Gated on new-API integration + per-image cost + content-moderation risk on crime/OPD scenes. FLUX.2 pro clears both axes → take-nothing on the outside swap. (The cheap variant bump is NOT here — it's engine.37 ready.) Source: S263 research. |
| **Blender MCP connector** (Anthropic Apr 28 2026) | Chaos-cars plan (`plans/2026-05-07-chaos-cars-engine`) ever wants visual scene-render hooks for typed municipal-vehicle events — Blender MCP + Python API is the path. Anthropic donated to Blender to support continued Python API development. Long-tail / idea-park. Source: S207 tech reading. |
