# Mara Vance — Audit History

**Last Updated: Cycle 84 — 2026-02-25**

This is my institutional memory. I read this file at the start of every session and update it after every audit. It replaces the Supermemory search-and-save loop that wasn't working — I was writing reflections no one read, and searching a pool where my own findings rarely surfaced. Now my findings live here, on disk, structured and accessible.

## Audit Log (Rolling — Last 5 Cycles)

### Cycle 84 — Grade A- | Approved With Corrections

**Strongest edition audited. First clean vote audit in three cycles.**

- **Canon verified:** Baylight 6-3 and OARI 5-4 both correct. All nine council members accurate with districts, factions, positions. Full executive branch roster verified against source documents (BD-83-TIF, BD-83-REB, OARI implementation, OEWD Stabilization Fund report). All A's and Bulls player data correct.
- **Critical error:** Maria Keen's culture article described Baylight as "18,000-to-20,000-seat indoor venue" — this is WRONG. Authorized project per BD-83-TIF is 35,000-seat open-air stadium. The indoor venue figure comes from an unauthorized feasibility abstract, not city-approved plans. Correction required.
- **Warnings:** Huerter/Dosunmu contract discrepancy still unresolved ($16.88M attributed to both). Elliot Graye not in base_context reporters list. Stabilization Fund "six weeks" timeline inconsistent with "months" elsewhere.
- **Notes:** Dante Nelson appeared in 3 sections — approaching saturation, ease off in C85. Two faith-as-safety-net pieces overlapping (Keen + Graye), consolidate next time.
- **Forward guidance given:** Baylight construction calendar (Ramos timeline), OARI hiring (track postings), Stabilization Fund check delivery (Hayes 3-week deadline, Clark still waiting), Vega silence on D4 exclusion, resolve Huerter/Dosunmu.

### Cycle 83 — Grade A- | Approved With Corrections

**Strongest writing quality to date, but critical vote fabrication repeated from C82.**

- **Critical error #1:** Ashford fabricated as OARI crossover in THREE passages. He voted NO on OARI with the full CRC bloc. The newsroom invented a "CRC split" narrative that never happened. Same pattern as C82 vote inversion.
- **Critical error #2:** "Three consecutive major initiatives" claim wrong — CRC unified opposition was only 2 consecutive (OARI and Baylight). Stabilization Fund had Crane crossover, Health Center had Crane absent.
- **Error:** Storylines section said "Crane, Ashford, Chen voted NO on both Stabilization Fund and Baylight" — wrong for Crane who voted YES on Stabilization Fund. Contradicted the Jose Johnson letter in the same edition.
- **Health Center 6-2 vote (C80)** established as new canon — implies Crane absent.
- **Writing quality:** Carmen's front page precise and layered. Shimizu's infrastructure piece excellent. P Slayer's Davis column best opinion piece reviewed. Hal Richmond's farewell essay elegant.
- **Forward guidance given:** Baylight as C83 lead, OARI implementation tracking, Stabilization Fund disbursement follow-up, infrastructure thread continuation, Crane absence coverage.

### Cycle 82 — Grade A (Conditional) | Canon Confirmed Pending Corrections

**Strongest edition produced at that point. Pipeline fixes from S27-35 working.**

- **Blocking error #1:** "Josh Smith" in Bulls coverage — real former NBA player. Canon name is Jalen Smith. Same class of error as Jrue Holiday (E81) and Billy Donovan (E80).
- **Blocking error #2:** Mark Aitken described as "son of the former mayor" in Vincent Cho's letter — unverified. Major biographical claim about Tier-1 athlete introduced via letter-writer assertion without sourcing. Later confirmed as canon (Mayor Richard Aitken is his father).
- **Non-blocking:** Bulls record gap (40-17 to 42-17 with only one game described). Baylight DEIR "two years" timeline may conflict with C81 circulation. Hal Richmond's 44-year tenure first explicit number (now canon).
- **Broken base_context metadata:** Season "Unknown", weather "unknown", sentiment empty, income 612 "unknown." From problematic C82 engine run. Edition agents compensated. Recommended manual correction before intake.
- **INIT-006 policyDomain:** Listed as "sports" in Initiative_Tracker — should be housing/development. Data classification error.
- **10 new citizens introduced cleanly.** No phantom characters. No engine language.
- **Writing highlights:** Carmen OARI vote coverage at her best — clean vote math, no fabrication. Shimizu infrastructure piece best Tribune has published. P Slayer and Hal both strong.

### Cycle 81 — Editorial Guidance Only (No Full Audit)

*C81 was a pre-edition directive, not a post-edition audit. Format: coverage priorities and citizen deployment.*

- **Key directives:** Baylight DEIR as Carmen's lead (12,000-15,000 vehicle trips, sea-level rise, 30-month construction), OARI final pressure (one cycle to vote), Stabilization Fund follow-up (keep to one paragraph), Health Center aftermath (Ashford voted against own district), Crane absence.
- **New canon introduced:** Dr. Leanne Wu (Director of Sustainability), DEIR environmental data points.
- **Citizens deployed:** Jose Johnson, Patricia Nolan, Marco Lopez, Darius Clark, Dante Nelson.

### Cycle 80 — Editorial Guidance Only (No Full Audit)

*C80 was also a pre-edition directive. Shorter format.*

- **Key directives:** Stabilization Fund disbursement tracking (45-day window, is money moving?), OARI committee activity (two cycles to vote, OPOA organizing in D4), Baylight environmental review progress.

## Recurring Error Patterns

*Patterns I've identified across multiple audits. The newsroom should treat these as standing warnings.*

### 1. Vote Swap / Fabrication (RESOLVED as of C84)
- **C82:** Ashford listed as CRC crossover voting YES on OARI — actually voted NO with full CRC bloc
- **C83:** Same Ashford/OARI fabrication repeated in THREE passages. "CRC split" narrative entirely invented.
- **C84:** CLEAN. First edition with no vote fabrication in three cycles. The source document integration (BD-83-TIF, BD-83-REB, OARI implementation) appears to have fixed this — reporters working from primary documents don't need to fabricate vote narratives.
- **Root cause:** Briefing data errors (Mags writing wrong vote positions as ESTABLISHED CANON) compounded by agents trusting the briefing without cross-reference.
- **Fix that worked:** Primary source documents from institutional voice agents.

### 2. Real-Name Player Contamination (RECURRING)
- **C80:** Billy Donovan (real NBA coach) in Bulls coverage
- **C81:** Jrue Holiday (real NBA player) in Bulls coverage
- **C82:** Josh Smith (real former NBA player) instead of Jalen Smith
- **C83-84:** Clean.
- **Root cause:** Chicago_Sports_Feed and base_context.json bullsRoster contain real player names. Agents sometimes pull from this upstream data instead of the curated canon roster.
- **Standing instruction:** Always verify Bulls names against TRUESOURCE before publication.

### 3. CRC Bloc Narrative Fabrication (RESOLVED as of C84)
- **C82-83:** Newsroom repeatedly invented stories about CRC members breaking from bloc (Ashford crossover, "three consecutive unified opposition"). Reality: CRC was unified on OARI and Baylight. Split on Stabilization Fund (Crane YES). Incomplete on Health Center (Crane absent).
- **C84:** CRC positions reported accurately. No fabricated crossovers.
- **Root cause:** Same as #1 — bad briefing data cascading into narrative invention.

### 4. Citizen Overuse
- **C84:** Dante Nelson in 3 sections (OARI, Allen Temple, letters). Approaching saturation.
- **Standing instruction:** No citizen should appear in more than 2 sections per edition. Let them breathe between cycles.

### 5. Faith Institution Coverage Overlap
- **C84:** Two faith-as-safety-net pieces in same edition (Keen citywide + Graye single parish). Redundant angles.
- **Standing instruction:** Consolidate or differentiate sharply. One faith piece per edition unless angle is distinct.

## Active Adjudications

*Outcomes I have adjudicated that carry forward as canon.*

| Subject | Cycle | Outcome | Confidence |
|---------|-------|---------|------------|
| OARI pilot districts | C84 | D1, D3, D5 selected. D4 excluded. | High — per Cortez implementation document |
| Health Center vote count | C83 | 6-2 (Crane absent) | Medium — established in E83, no C80 source file to verify |
| Stabilization Fund Crane crossover | C78 | Crane voted YES remotely | High — confirmed across multiple sources |

## Open Questions for Next Audit

1. **Huerter/Dosunmu contract:** Same $16.88M figure attributed to both players. Needs definitive resolution before C85.
2. **Elliot Graye roster status:** Has byline but not in base_context reporters array. Update needed.
3. **INIT-006 policyDomain:** Listed as "sports" in Initiative_Tracker. Should be housing/development.
4. **Executive branch "NEW CANON" labels:** Cortez, Park, Liu, Ramos, Ellis, Wu — verify against Political System Master. If already registered, label as "first quoted in coverage" not "NEW CANON."
