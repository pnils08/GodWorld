MARK AITKEN — FULL EXPANDED INTERVIEW + DUGOUT SCENE + INDEX

Interview Feature (Expanded)

P Slayer: Charity event tonight. Suit, lights, cameras, donors. Why you?
Mark Aitken: Because I don’t do charity unless I can track it. Feel-good moments fade. Data doesn’t. If I’m involved, I want a ledger—what changed, who benefitted, where the gaps still are.

P Slayer: You treat kindness like engineering.
Mark: Everything works better with structure. People think compassion is soft. It isn’t. It’s architecture. You build it right or it collapses under emotion. If we run a camp for kids, I want to know which kid learned plate discipline, which one gained confidence, and which one needs a different kind of support next time.

P Slayer: You’re known as The Iron Corner. Fans talk about your discipline like it’s a superpower.
Mark: It’s not a superpower. It’s a habit. I learned early that baseball is numbers until it becomes chaos. You prepare for the numbers so the chaos feels manageable. Third base is reaction—instinct and angles. If your mind is clean, the ball looks bigger.

P Slayer: Off the field, are you the same way?
Mark: Mostly. But I’m also not a machine. I just know how fast life tilts if you stop paying attention. My job is to stabilize what I can, so the people around me don’t have to carry the weight alone.

P Slayer: Send a message to the quiet kid standing in the back of that baseball camp who thinks talent skipped him.
Mark: Talent didn’t skip you. Talent doesn’t have a map. But consistency knows your address. Sign for it.

Dugout Interview Scene — Photo-Ready Prompt

Scene Prompt:
Mark Aitken in the Oakland Athletics dugout before a game, uniform clean, cleats loosely tied as if he’s still warming up. He’s leaning forward on the dugout railing, turning slightly toward P Slayer who is interviewing him with a recorder. A small stack of baseball camp flyers or wristbands sits beside Mark—visual nod to his charity and youth programs. Lighting is cool pre-game stadium lights mixed with natural shadows. Mark’s expression: focused, thoughtful, analytical. Background includes bats in the rack and a blurred field beyond. Photography style: sports magazine realism, clean detail, shallow depth of field.
