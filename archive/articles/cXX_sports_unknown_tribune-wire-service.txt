Trade Monitoring Note — Peter Busch

Multiple league sources have indicated that several contending clubs have contacted Oakland regarding outfielder Peter Busch. At this time, no negotiations have been confirmed, and the Athletics have not publicly signaled that Busch is available. However, the inquiries are consistent with increased interest around the league as rosters begin planning for the offseason and potential September adjustments.

According to individuals familiar with the situation, teams checking in have primarily asked about Busch’s availability in the context of acquiring a controllable bat with defensive flexibility. In return, Oakland is believed to be evaluating potential packages built around young pitching or outfield prospects, though no specific names have been linked to the conversations.

Internally, the emergence of J.R. Rosado in left field has created speculation that the organization may explore additional roster configurations heading into next season. Busch remains under team control and has not requested a move, and there is currently no indication that the front office is actively shopping him. The situation is best characterized as inquiry-driven rather than transition-driven.

The Tribune will continue monitoring updates as more information becomes available.
