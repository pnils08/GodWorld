“We Broke Darrin’s Heart and He Still Showed Up”
I don’t know how to say this without sounding like I’m writing his obituary, so I’ll just say it:
We lost Darrin Davis twice in 2040, and the second time felt like watching someone die who was already dead.
August 5th: ACL sprain, two weeks. The MVP race leader. Gone. We told ourselves two weeks wasn’t forever. Thomas Gasper filled in. Fine. Adequate. Not Darrin.
Then September 26th—broken ankle, 1-2 months. Second injury stint. Playoff run without the engine. Without the 38-homer, .575-slugging, actual reigning MVP who defined this team’s offensive identity for a decade.
Do you know what it’s like to watch Ernesto Quintero—who is 23 years old and very good, don’t get me wrong—step into Darrin’s spot for the playoff push? It’s like watching your dad’s replacement at Thanksgiving dinner. Technically functional. Fundamentally wrong.
And here’s the part that guts me: Darrin rehabbed. Darrin pushed. Darrin tried to come back for us even though his ankle was held together with hope and spite. And we still lost the ALCS.
I don’t have advanced metrics for heartbreak. Anthony can tell you Darrin’s wRC+ or his BsR or whatever alphabet soup explains value. I can only tell you this: we asked him to be Superman for nine years, and the one year he couldn’t fly, we fell.
That’s not his fault. That’s not anyone’s fault. That’s just the cruelest thing baseball knows how to do.
