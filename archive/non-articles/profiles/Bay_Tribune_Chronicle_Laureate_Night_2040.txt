Bay Tribune – “The Chronicle Laureate Night” (2040 Press Guild Awards)

The year was 2040, and the Bay Tribune shattered precedent. For the first time in its history, a regional newsroom took home the National Press Guild’s “Chronicle Laureate Award for Excellence in Long-Form Sports Journalism.”

It wasn’t just a trophy — it was vindication.

The Winning Series: “The Calm and the Storm”
The award honored the Tribune’s serialized anthology chronicling two decades of Oakland baseball — The Calm and the Storm, written collaboratively by Hal Richmond, Anthony, Mags Corliss, and P Slayer. Each piece blurred the boundary between journalism and literature: Richmond’s elegiac retrospectives, Anthony’s grounded reportage, Mags’s editorial weaving of human truths, and Slayer’s raw modern edge. Together they created something more than coverage — they built a living archive.

That Night on the Terrace
The photo captures it perfectly. The rooftop lights hung low over a spring skyline, the Bay breathing below them.
Hal’s laughter came from somewhere deep — pride mixed with disbelief. Anthony’s grin was pure release, the former ballplayer in him surfacing after years behind a pen. Mags, radiant and sharp in black, lifted her glass and said, “To truth — may we never run out of it.”
Slayer, younger and brooding but smiling at last, raised his own glass and murmured, “To the ones who taught us how to remember.”

They toasted not just to a win, but to legacy. Behind them, the city lights mirrored their own — flickering but alive.

The Citation
The official commendation from the National Press Guild read:
“For sustained excellence in narrative truth-telling that redefined modern sports writing, transforming a baseball dynasty into an epic of memory, morality, and meaning.”

Aftermath and Legacy
That award marked a generational passing of the torch — Richmond’s mentorship officially realized, the Tribune’s voice elevated to the national stage.
Months later, UC Berkeley announced an archive project to preserve The Calm and the Storm series as part of its “American Sports Memory Collection.”

Hal would retire the following year, Anthony would be promoted to senior correspondent, Mags would be named editorial director, and P Slayer — the wildcard — would turn down syndication offers to keep writing for Oakland.
