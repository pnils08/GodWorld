- **Source:** phase05-citizens/citizenContextBuilder.js
- **Diagnosis:** Type 2 (defensive-fallback sibling, multi-sheet). Writer references 'EngineCycle' which has no exact live-header match, but a nearby sibling literal 'Cycle' exact-matches a live header on one of the writer's target sheets. Acceptable noise.
- **Status:** OPEN

### G-EC22 — citizenContextBuilder.js defensive-fallback literal 'UsageType' (sibling 'Name' matches) [mechanical] [header-drift] [LOW]

- **Source:** phase05-citizens/citizenContextBuilder.js
- **Diagnosis:** Type 2 (defensive-fallback sibling, multi-sheet). Writer references 'UsageType' which has no exact live-header match, but a nearby sibling literal 'Name' exact-matches a live header on one of the writer's target sheets. Acceptable noise.
- **Status:** OPEN

### G-EC23 — citizenContextBuilder.js defensive-fallback literal 'Context' (sibling 'Name' matches) [mechanical] [header-drift] [LOW]

- **Source:** phase05-citizens/citizenContextBuilder.js
- **Diagnosis:** Type 2 (defensive-fallback sibling, multi-sheet). Writer references 'Context' which has no exact live-header match, but a nearby sibling literal 'Name' exact-matches a live header on one of the writer's target sheets. Acceptable noise.

### G-EC26 — cycleExportAutomation.js defensive-fallback literal 'Cycle' on 'World_Population' (sibling 'cycle' matches) [mechanical] [header-drift] [LOW]

- **Source:** phase10-persistence/cycleExportAutomation.js
- **Diagnosis:** Type 2 (defensive-fallback sibling). Writer's literal 'Cycle' has a case-variant 'cycle' on 'World_Population', AND a nearby sibling literal 'cycle' exact-matches the live header. The fallback chain handles both cases — 'Cycle' is defensive, not silent-fail. Acceptable noise; no fix needed.

### G-EC28 — cohort-collision — V2-runtime (engine-run-log ingest path not yet built) [mechanical] [cohort-collision] [INFO]

- **Diagnosis:** Detection requires Apps Script execution-log capture into the local repo. /run-cycle Step 3 currently runs engine in Google's cloud and does not persist execution logs locally. When that ingest path lands, this class becomes mechanically detectable.
- **Status:** V2-PENDING

### G-EC29 — Prior cycle's gap log (C113) had 45 entries — manual review for repeats recommended [mechanical] [cross-cycle-debt] [INFO]

- **Diagnosis:** Cross-cycle pattern detection beyond stuck-initiative is judgment-layer work. Read output/production_log_run_cycle_c113_gaps.md OPEN entries and flag any that recur in this cycle's findings.
- **Status:** OPEN

### G-EC30 — phase-ordering — V2-runtime (engine-run-log ingest path not yet built) [mechanical] [phase-ordering] [INFO]

- **Diagnosis:** Detection requires Apps Script execution-log capture into the local repo. /run-cycle Step 3 currently runs engine in Google's cloud and does not persist execution logs locally. When that ingest path lands, this class becomes mechanically detectable.
- **Status:** V2-PENDING

### G-EC31 — phase-skip — V2-runtime (engine-run-log ingest path not yet built) [mechanical] [phase-skip] [INFO]

- **Diagnosis:** Detection requires Apps Script execution-log capture into the local repo. /run-cycle Step 3 currently runs engine in Google's cloud and does not persist execution logs locally. When that ingest path lands, this class becomes mechanically detectable.
- **Status:** V2-PENDING

### G-EC32 — silent-fail — V2-runtime (engine-run-log ingest path not yet built) [mechanical] [silent-fail] [INFO]

- **Diagnosis:** Detection requires Apps Script execution-log capture into the local repo. /run-cycle Step 3 currently runs engine in Google's cloud and does not persist execution logs locally. When that ingest path lands, this class becomes mechanically detectable.
- **Status:** V2-PENDING

*Coder voice: terse, mechanical, commit-message style. Tag each entry `[judgment]`. Use G-EC{N+} numbering continuing from the mechanical pass.*


### G-EC33 — run-cycle chain called locked skills; 50 SKILL.md carried disable-model-invocation since c5d6ebd43 [judgment] [process] [HIGH]
- Steps 1/2/4/5 of /run-cycle name skills the Skill tool refused to load. Prior sessions ran the underlying scripts by hand; es did not write the C114 review. Builder: "Take all the locks off." Flag off in all 50 (cbeddf759). Review write-up for C114 landed 16:24, ~55 min after the fire.
- **Status:** CLOSED (cbeddf759)

### G-EC34 — Civis journal C114: two runs, no entry [judgment] [civis-journal] [MED]
- Run 1: Sonnet returned prose not JSON (`Unexpected token 'L', "Last week "…`); reasoner fallback 309 words, failed "one lead and two or three carried findings". Run 2 (permitted re-run): Sonnet failed "private identifier or machine vocabulary in prose"; fallback 188 words, same structure failure. No journal this week; no files; delivery sends nothing for C114.
- Pattern: Sonnet route has not passed the prose gate in either run; the structural assertion ("one lead + 2–3 carried") fails on both routes. Prompt/assertion mismatch candidate, not a data fault.
- **Status:** OPEN (pipeline.68)

### G-EC35 — Anomalies POP-01223 / POP-01224 income ×45 / ×14 routed to engine-debug [judgment] [anomaly] [MED]
- Oaks 2nd-round picks promoted Tier 4 C113; income 100000 → 4.5M / 1.4M at C114. Rookie contract on a mint placeholder, or a bug — detector cannot tell; builder has not ruled. `output/engine_anomalies_c114_followup.md`.
- **Status:** OPEN (builder)

### G-EC36 — Citizen scoreboard: 6 outcomes / 2528 lines; 0 married, 0 promoted, 0 laid off [judgment] [dice] [MED]
- 1 born, 3 hired, 1 bought, 1 sold. 8 tier-ups, 5 of them journalists. Second quiet life-week read; rate/severity are the builder's dials. Recorded, not tuned.
- **Status:** OPEN (builder)

### G-EC37 — Auditor emits the EventAttractiveness overshoot measurement twice in patterns[] [judgment] [auditor] [LOW]
- Two identical `improvement` entries ("Remedy overshot expectation on Neighborhood_Map.EventAttractiveness: observed 0.24 (expected 0.02)"). Counted twice in summary.improvements (14 → 13 distinct). engineAuditor measureRemedies 1.0.0.
- **Status:** OPEN

### G-EC38 — Step 2.5 pre-fire hand-write cell list not on disk [judgment] [process] [LOW]
- es's record says the pre-fire check ran; no output file. Post-fire check against the C114 close: 0/0/0 + 0 tracker moves. If a pre-fire cell list existed it is unrecoverable; C114 briefs carry no artifact from the three covered tabs.
- **Status:** CLOSED (unrecoverable; no artifact found)

### G-EC39 — DEPLOY_HISTORY §PROD tops at stage 36; C114 fired on stage 37 (@173, transit reader) [judgment] [docs] [LOW]
- Entry owed (NEXT[research-build], 18cc893df).
- **Status:** OPEN

### G-EC40 — buildNeighborhoodTexture warned "Rockridge: possible metric/system-word leak" [judgment] [texture] [LOW]
- Block reads: "retail strip is bustling … BART delays … New residents from Downtown". No metric word present; "retail" trips the blocklist. False positive; block shipped as written.
- **Status:** CLOSED (false positive)

### G-EC41 — Content drafter wrote 10 rows Active=yes (auth:auto) [judgment] [content-ledger] [INFO]
- 7 lines + 2 fragments + 1 line across Fruitvale, West Oakland, Temescal, Jack London, Brooklyn, Downtown, KONO, Rockridge. Readback verified. Builder kill switch: Active=no in-sheet.
- **Status:** CLOSED
