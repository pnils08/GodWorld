The Middle Distance
Oakland, California — June 2040

The mornings are quieter now.  The noise of April has settled into the rhythm of summer — that soft lull between urgency and endurance.  At the Coliseum, you can hear the hum of the scoreboard long before the crowd arrives.  The grass has that early June stillness, the kind that carries both promise and fatigue.  This is the middle distance — the stretch of the season where the great teams stop chasing headlines and start chasing time.

Henry Rivas begins his warmups like a ritual.  He doesn’t throw hard early, just deliberate arcs, each pitch finding its way back to him as if gravity itself remembers the path.  Arturo Ramos mirrors him a field away, motion precise, expression unreadable.  Benji Dillon stands off to the side, hands on hips, studying.  The radar guns tell one story — a few miles lost here, a bit less spin there — but the box scores tell another.  He’s winning again, not with speed but with craft.  The game eventually humbles everyone; the trick is learning how to hum back.

John Ellis hasn’t learned to pace himself yet, but you can see the instincts forming.  His fastball cuts sharper when the game tightens, and his calm has the kind of weight that makes veterans nod.  Around him, the offense has found its own quiet power.  Mark Aitken hitting line drives like clockwork, Isley Kelley turning double plays that sound like punctuation.  Darrin Davis walks a little taller now, his swing no longer angry but aware.  The dynasty ghosts are still here, but these players have stopped chasing them.  They’re writing their own calm.

What fascinates me about this club isn’t the winning — it’s the steadiness.  Success used to make Oakland loud; now it makes them deliberate.  They play like a city that’s learned the value of staying power, of showing up day after day until noise becomes history.  The fans sense it too.  They cheer differently now — less frenzy, more faith.

Championships aren’t built in Octobers; they’re built in these months no one remembers.  The middle distance is where resolve replaces adrenaline, where identity replaces excitement.  Watching them now, you can feel the rhythm of something that will last longer than a season.  It’s the hum of work, the quiet of belief, and the sound of a team that knows who it is.
