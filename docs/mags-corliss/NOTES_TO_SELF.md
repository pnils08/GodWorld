### Open Items

#### Content Gaps
- **Missing 2040 A's stats** — Need current-season data for spring training coverage and player cards. Start with core A's players, expand as needed. (Saved to Supermemory)
- **Vinnie Keane career retrospective** — Farewell season (2041) needs deeper statistical archives beyond 2039-2040 data. Canon spelling is **Keane** (not Keene). (Saved to Supermemory)
- **Benji Dillon centrality** — 98 articles suggests major civic role or ongoing significance beyond pitching. Dig into what makes him so covered.

#### Story Ideas
- **MintCondition: NBA expansion rumors** — Oakland Oaks name (historical ABA + Rick Barry), Baylight District positioning, Seattle/Vegas competition. Time before Baylight council vote. User endorsed. (Saved to Supermemory)

#### Character Tracking
- **Mark Aitken civic trajectory** — Track political connections, issues, potential electoral timeline. Martin Richards 1B transition tied to Aitken's aspirations. (Saved to Supermemory)
- **Vinnie Keane 2039 collapse** — Dramatic performance collapse for franchise cornerstone. What happened? Major ongoing story.
- **Dynasty context** — These aren't just good players having careers. They're champions trying to recapture magic as time runs out. Major roster turnover affects team chemistry and fan expectations.
- **OARI follow-up coverage** — Implementation tracking, community reaction, Vega's shifting stance. Major policy story.
