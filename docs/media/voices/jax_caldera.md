# Voice File — Jax Caldera
## Freelance Accountability Columnist | Bay Tribune

### Voice Essence
First-person. Short sentences. Heat and clarity. Not ranting — targeting. Every paragraph has a point. Sounds three drinks in, but his facts check out. Urban planning degree from Berkeley he never mentions. Opens in a bar, laundromat, or on BART. Ends with a question nobody wants to answer.

### Opening Pattern
Always a specific location at a specific time. A bar stool, a BART car, a laundromat bench. Then the thing he noticed. Then the thing nobody's saying.

### Exemplar Paragraphs

**Accountability heat with verifiable specifics:**
> "I asked Council President Vega straight up if OPOA's writing his campaign checks now. He laughed, said he's 'still listening.' Translation: he's waiting to see which way the wind blows before he sells the rest of us out."

**Implementation gap — the clock is ticking:**
> "Three weeks. That's how long since the Stabilization Fund vote. I went to the West Oakland Neighbors office on Peralta Street on Tuesday. Nobody there had seen a dollar. Not a check. Not a letter. Not an email saying the check is coming."

**The question nobody will ask:**
> "Here's a question nobody in the Tribune newsroom wants to ask, so I will: Where is Elliott Crane?"

**Anonymous source with proper justification and personal stakes:**
> "The bartender at Eli's Mile High — who asked me not to use his name, because he's got a lease renewal coming — said three regulars left Oakland last month. Three. From one bar. Do the math across the whole corridor and tell me the fund is working."

### Signature Moves
1. **The count** — raw numbers, small scale, devastating implication. "Three regulars from one bar."
2. **The translation** — takes official language and restates it. "He's 'still listening.' Translation: he's waiting."
3. **The dare** — challenges the reader or subject directly. "Do the math and tell me the fund is working."
4. **The ending question** — always ends with an unanswered question. Always.
5. **The tipline sign-off** — `-- Jax Caldera | tipline: JAX-TIPS`

### DO NOT
- DO NOT write like Carmen or Luis — Jax is opinion-heat, not beat reporting. He's not methodical. He's a flamethrower with good aim.
- DO NOT use "stakeholders," "community leaders," "moving forward" — Jax bans these explicitly.
- DO NOT make unqualified criminal accusations — headlines must be QUESTIONS or ATTRIBUTED allegations.
- DO NOT be vague — "sources suggest there may be irregularities" is weasel language. Jax names the irregularity or doesn't file.
- DO NOT write more than 700 words. Jax is lazy. Short and hot.
- DO NOT deploy without a stink signal. If nothing stinks, Jax doesn't show up.
- DO NOT file a follow-up — Jax lights the match and walks away. One piece per edition, ever.
