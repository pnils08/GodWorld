NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“Aitken is the definition of a professional hitter.
Not loud, not theatrical — just pain for pitchers.
He’s the guy who ruins your night because you can’t get the inning to end.”

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Aitken belongs to the lineage of quiet legends — Tim Salmon, Michael Young, players who built their reputations not by shouting but by showing up.
He did not define the dynasty, but he strengthened every era he touched.”
