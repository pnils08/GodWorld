Hank Trepagnier_background

El Salvador.

Not a basketball country. Not a pipeline. Not a place where scouts go looking for 6’11” centers with 73 three-point ratings and the athleticism to run the floor like a guard. Trepagnier grew up in San Salvador playing fútbol until he was fifteen, when a growth spurt changed everything. By seventeen he was playing for a club team in Mexico City. By nineteen he was in the G League on a tryout contract nobody expected to convert.

Paulson found him in summer league footage. That’s the story everyone keeps telling. But I talked to someone in the Bulls front office who was in the room when Paulson first pulled up the tape.

“He watched one possession. Trepagnier caught a pass at the elbow, pump-faked a closeout, took one dribble, and dunked on two guys. Mike just said, ‘Get him.’ That was it. ‘Get him.’”

The scouting report said he couldn’t shoot. The scouting report was wrong — or Trepagnier figured it out in the last eighteen months. His three-point stroke is unconventional but it goes in. His free throw is clean. And his standing dunk rating is reportedly the highest on the roster.

But here’s the thing about Trepagnier: his personality file says “Wildcard.” That’s a real designation. It means the organization doesn’t know what they’re getting night to night. It means the ceiling is high and the floor is unpredictable.

Opening night was the ceiling. 10-for-10. 26 points. The United Center chanting a name nobody knew six months ago.

The question is what happens next.
