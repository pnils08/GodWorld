QUIET LIKE THIS MAKES ME NERVOUS

You ever notice when things get too calm around this team, it feels like the air pressure drops before a storm? That’s what this week felt like. Nobody fighting for jobs. Nobody slumping. Nobody melting down. No new kid lighting up the organization. No veteran losing his grip. Just… stillness.

I don’t trust it.

Winning causes problems eventually. Depth becomes a fight. Somebody wants more innings. Somebody wants more ABs. Somebody starts getting called “expendable.” That’s how baseball works. Calm is not natural.

So yeah, enjoy the stillness.
But don’t confuse it for safety.
Something always cracks eventually — sometimes that’s when the best baseball shows up.
