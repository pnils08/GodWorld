# Deploy to Apps Script

**Deploys are the engine-sheet terminal's function (S282).** The full checklist (pre-flight,
verification, bookkeeping) lives in `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` — this file is the
minimal manual procedure.

**Deploy gate (S282):** `clasp push` is blocked unless `CLAUDE_CTL=1` is set — an opt-in
speed bump so other agents can't deploy to the live engine (same pattern as the S274 git
control-plane gate). `npm install` re-arms the gate automatically via `postinstall`.

## From this repo (usual path)

```bash
cd /root/GodWorld
CLAUDE_CTL=1 npx clasp push
```

## From Cloud Shell (manual fallback)

```bash
cd ~/GodWorld
git pull
npm install          # also re-arms the deploy gate
CLAUDE_CTL=1 npx clasp push
```

## First time setup (only once)

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pnils08/GodWorld.git
cd GodWorld
npm install
npx clasp login
CLAUDE_CTL=1 npx clasp push
```

## If Cloud Shell resets

Cloud Shell sometimes clears installed packages. If clasp fails, run `npm install` first.

## Sandbox (vetting environment — Mike-direct 2026-07-06)

**All upgrades are vetted on the sandbox before a new live cycle runs.** If something
accidentally deploys to live, Mike can cycle live back via its version history — but the
sandbox is the intended target for anything unverified.

**CURRENT sandbox: `SANDBOX 0714`** (stood up S318 2026-07-14, live copy at C101 → first test cycle C102)
- Spreadsheet ID `1wmZTGqIbYL7eVYCplq3iCb2oOGDZ0Inq-pWCtnD1lzc`
  URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wmZTGqIbYL7eVYCplq3iCb2oOGDZ0Inq-pWCtnD1lzc/edit
- Bound Apps Script ID: PENDING (Mike: Extensions → Apps Script → Project Settings → Script ID)
- Sheet deltas vs live: col P renamed CreatedAt → `SpouseId` (exact case — code reads it by name)

**RETIRED: `SANDBOX_0702`** (S318 — broken col-Q incident C134; do not deploy or write)
- Spreadsheet `1syShVWfudY0eCC9rnR7AWZ8-b-fs5RpJW2bhn6nZtzs` / script `1bT3o5r6adZhSv20pa0ijoHv_HdeEbONtBT2bsw_8U-sHbWgyJz94ueIW`

### Standing up a NEW sandbox (protocol, S318)
1. **Mike:** in Drive, File → Make a copy of the live spreadsheet (the bound Apps
   Script copies with it — automatically bound to the copy).
2. **Mike:** open the copy → Extensions → Apps Script → Project Settings → copy the
   **Script ID** to the terminal.
3. **Isolation is by construction** — verified S318: the engine contains zero
   `openById` calls; the bound script only ever touches its own container. No
   wrapper needed. (Node scripts are the only cross-container access and take
   explicit sheet IDs — never rely on env default when targeting a sandbox.)
4. **Terminal:** update THIS section (new IDs, retire the old ones), then clasp
   push via the temp-dir route below, then replay any pending data migrations
   against the new sheet ID (dry-run → apply → read-back verify).
5. Triggers do NOT copy — sandbox cycles are Mike-fired from the sheet, which is
   the intended mode.
- **Sandbox clasp deploy:** copy repo to a temp dir, drop a `.clasp.json` with the sandbox
  Script ID + the project `.claspignore`, `CLAUDE_CTL=1 npx clasp push -f`. The production
  `.clasp.json` at repo root is never touched. (Route defined in
  [[../plans/2026-07-04-ripple-ledger-attribution]] §Sandbox identity.)
  **⚠️ `.clasp.json` is GIT-TRACKED with the PRODUCTION script ID** — any repo-copy step
  (`git archive | tar -x`, `cp -r`, `rsync`) lands the production ID in the staging dir.
  Writing the sandbox `.clasp.json` must be the LAST step before push, and every sandbox
  push is preceded by verifying the staged file carries the sandbox ID
  (`grep 1bT3o5r6 .clasp.json`). S316 incident: a re-extract over an existing staging dir
  silently restored the production ID and one sandbox-intended push landed on the
  production script.
- **Node scripts against the sandbox:** `GODWORLD_SHEET_ID` in the env points at
  **production** — always pass the sandbox explicitly, e.g.
  `node scripts/draftContentRows.js --cycle {XX} --apply --sheet-id 1wmZTGqIbYL7eVYCplq3iCb2oOGDZ0Inq-pWCtnD1lzc`
- Cycle runs are Mike-fired from the sandbox sheet; SANDBOX 0714 starts at C102.
