Level: Double-A (eligible for promotion)
Handedness: Right
DOB: —
Evaluator: Player Development / Hitting Lab

Season-to-Date Batted Ball Metrics (Double-A)

Max Exit Velocity: 112.6 mph
Average Exit Velocity: 89.1 mph
Hard-Hit Rate: 42.4%
Barrel Rate: 3.8%
Sweet-Spot Rate: 19.9%

Average Launch Angle: 2.7°
Launch Angle Variance: 21.1°

Ground-Ball Rate: 62.0%
Line-Drive Rate: 17.9%
Fly-Ball Rate: 20.1%

xwOBA: .335
Actual wOBA: .289
Underperformance Gap: –.046

Summary:
Raw contact authority is well above the level. Trajectory remains the inhibitor.

⸻

High-Impact Contact (≥ 100 mph)
	•	Total: 73
	•	Grounders: 51
	•	Line drives: 14
	•	Fly balls: 8

Key Diagnostic:
Forty-nine percent of all hard contact occurs below +5° launch angle — classic “low-lift power” prospect profile.

⸻

Swing Characteristics (via Lab Sensors)

Bat Speed: 70.2 mph
Attack Angle: –4.1°
Vertical Bat Angle: –27°
Hip–Shoulder Separation: 43°
Contact Depth vs. League Avg: +3.0 inches (deeper)

Hitting Lab Interpretation:
A strong rotational mover with a deep contact point. Produces power behind him rather than out front. Swing is built to hit low pitches extremely hard but has no natural upward path.

Pitch-Type Breakdown (Double-A Sample)

Four-Seamers
	•	Hard-hit rate: 47%
	•	AVG LA: –0.6°
	•	wOBA: .251
Velocity beats him to the spot; contact too deep.

Breaking Balls
	•	Hard-hit rate: 39%
	•	AVG LA: 6.4°
	•	wOBA: .311
Tends to lift spin better than velocity.

Changeups
	•	Hard-hit rate: 44%
	•	AVG LA: 10.1°
	•	wOBA: .346
Shows natural lift when timing is slowed — indicator of projectability.

⸻

Spray Tendencies

Pull:
	•	AVG LA: 1.3°
	•	Hard-hit grounders: 19
	•	Fly balls ≥ 98 mph: 2

Center:
	•	AVG LA: 3.9°
	•	Hard-hit events: 33
	•	Average projected distance: 263 ft

Opposite:
	•	AVG LA: 0.8°
	•	Oppo grounders: 15
	•	Oppo fly balls: 1

Summary:
All-field power potential — none of the fields unlock loft.

⸻

Developmental Path — “Lift Conversion Track”

The organization projects improvement via:
	•	Early contact training
	•	Adjusted hand slot and shoulder tilt
	•	Machine fastballs at the top of zone
	•	Attack-angle progression from negative angle to +4° over 6–10 weeks
	•	Occasional “one-hand finish” rounds to encourage upward axis

Expected timeline: noticeable transformation in 25–35 games.

⸻

Optimized Model Projection (Same EV, Corrected LA)

Simulated using a corrected launch angle window (8°–17°).

Projected Changes:
	•	HR Pace: From 10→21 over full season
	•	Projected SLG: .501
	•	Projected Barrel Rate: 11.4%
	•	Projected wOBA: .369
	•	Average Hard-Hit Distance: 317 ft (+31 ft)

Organizational Flag: High breakout probability with mechanical refinement.

Promotion Recommendation

“The underlying power is too real to ignore. He’s an exit-velocity monster stuck in the mud. With even moderate lift, he plays in the middle of a major-league lineup. Without it, he becomes a ground-ball extra-base tease. Assign to Hitting Lab Track C for elevation protocol.”
