NATIONAL DESK — Dana Reeve

WHY QUIET WEEKS NEVER MAKE NATIONAL COVERAGE — AND WHY THEY SHOULD

Oakland had a clean civic cycle this week. Hospitals steady. Employment steady. Services steady. For national networks, that’s not a story at all.

But stability matters. Cities that avoid spikes in emergency volume, staffing shortages, or community disruptions often set the long-term trends everyone else studies later. Oakland just had one of those weeks. It won’t appear on cable news, but it should — because the absence of crisis is itself newsworthy.
