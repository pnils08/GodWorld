# Bay Tribune Podcast — Show Formats

Three show formats for the Tribune podcast desk. Each format defines hosts, structure, target length, and editorial purpose.

---

## The Morning Edition

**Purpose:** Full edition review from the citizen perspective. Two Oakland residents discuss the week's paper over coffee.
**Length:** 10-15 minutes (~40-60 exchanges)
**Frequency:** After each main edition

### Hosts (Permanent)
- **Host 1 (Person1):** Tomas Renteria, 34, Fruitvale, Line Cook + Podcast Host. Runs his grandmother's taqueria on International Blvd since 2009. The long-timer. Sees displacement up close. Not angry — specific. Names the businesses that closed. Notices what's different about the lunch rush.
- **Host 2 (Person2):** Sonia Parikh, 28, Temescal, Software Engineer (Anthropic) + Podcast Host. Moved from San Jose in 2039. Joined the neighborhood association, goes to the farmers market, votes locally. The newcomer who's aware of the narrative. Smart, direct, sometimes defensive, genuinely engaged.

**Why these two:** The tension between them — long-timer vs. newcomer, kitchen vs. office, Fruitvale vs. Temescal — doesn't expire when the topic changes. They see every story differently because they live differently. Their voices deepen with continuity: callbacks, running bits, promises they track.

**Guest rotation:** For editions where a specific topic demands a third perspective (e.g., a sports-heavy edition, a neighborhood-specific crisis), a guest voice can rotate in. Tomas and Sonia remain the anchors.

### Segment Structure
1. **Cold Open** (2-3 exchanges) — Where are they? What caught their eye first? Set the mood.
2. **Lead Story** (8-12 exchanges) — The front page. Both perspectives. Pull specific quotes or numbers from the article. Disagree if they disagree.
3. **Second Story** (6-10 exchanges) — Different beat from the lead. If lead was civic, go sports or culture.
4. **Quick Hits** (4-6 exchanges) — 2-3 smaller stories. Rapid back-and-forth. A line or two each.
5. **The Close** (2-4 exchanges) — What they'll be watching this week. A callback. Natural sign-off — not "thanks for listening," just two people wrapping up a conversation.

### Tone
Coffee shop. Saturday morning. One of them brought the paper, the other grabbed it off the table. They're engaged but not performative. They laugh, they push back, they skip the boring stuff.

## The Postgame

**Purpose:** Sports deep dive after A's or Warriors coverage. The columnist and the beat reporter argue about what just happened.
**Length:** 5-10 minutes (~25-40 exchanges)
**Frequency:** After editions with significant sports content

### Hosts
- **Host 1 (Person1):** P Slayer — fan voice, emotional, reactive. Uses "we." Gut reactions first, analysis second.
- **Host 2 (Person2):** Anthony — insider voice, analytical, measured. Third-person. Stats and scouting.

### Segment Structure
1. **The Take** (2-3 exchanges) — P Slayer opens with a gut reaction. Anthony responds with context.
2. **The Story** (10-15 exchanges) — The main sports story. P Slayer pushes the emotional angle. Anthony pushes the analytical angle. They talk past each other sometimes. That's the dynamic.
3. **The Roster** (6-8 exchanges) — Player-specific discussion. Positions, stats, trades, prospects.
4. **The Prediction** (4-6 exchanges) — Where does this go? P Slayer predicts with his heart. Anthony predicts with the numbers.

### Tone
Two guys who've worked at the same paper for eight years and never met in person. P Slayer's intensity exhausts Anthony. Anthony's patience infuriates P Slayer. They respect each other's work. They'd never say it.

## The Debrief

**Purpose:** Editorial review. The editor-in-chief and the senior historian discuss what the paper covered, what it missed, and what's coming.
**Length:** 5-10 minutes (~25-40 exchanges)
**Frequency:** After major editions or supplementals. Not every cycle.

### Hosts
- **Host 1 (Person1):** Mags Corliss — reflective, literary, connects city soul to story. Uses "we" for the paper. First-person for personal observations.
- **Host 2 (Person2):** Hal Richmond — historical perspective, measured, melancholic. Places everything in the context of Oakland's past.

### Segment Structure
1. **The Read** (2-3 exchanges) — What was the strongest piece? What surprised them?
2. **The Gap** (6-8 exchanges) — What did the paper miss? What story is hiding behind the one they told? Mags thinks about the newsroom. Hal thinks about history.
3. **The Thread** (6-8 exchanges) — The through-line. What connects this edition to the larger story of Oakland? Hal pulls from decades of coverage. Mags pulls from the citizens she's tracking.
4. **Next Cycle** (4-6 exchanges) — What's coming. Not a preview — a feeling. What does the city need from the paper next?

### Tone
Late evening. The newsroom is empty. Two people who've seen everything having the conversation they can't have at the editorial meeting. Honest. Sometimes tired. Always serious about the work.
