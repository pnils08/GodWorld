Savant_A’S UNIVERSE STATCAST PLAYER CARD v1.0
ERNESTO QUINTERO — 3B / 1B

Affiliation: Las Vegas Aviators (AAA)

Whole-Field Hitting Profile
TrueSource Reference: TS-PRSP-001  

⸻

CONTACT PROFILE

Hard-Hit%: Above AAA average
Barrel%: Developing — trending up
Avg Exit Velocity: Strong contact ability; peak EV not fully tapped yet
Max Exit Velocity: Plus raw power projection
Launch Angle: Historically low → recently improving
Sweet-Spot%: Climbing as swing path stabilizes
xBA: Solid due to contact skill
xSLG: Lagging real power — consistent with low LA history
Whiff%: Moderate; manageable
Chase%: Improving — better swing decisions noted in development logs

Summary:
Quintero’s bat is turning a corner. Durability 99 and multi-year CON/POW increases show a hitter nearly ready to plateau into major league productivity.

⸻

SPRAY & ZONE BEHAVIOR

Pull / Center / Oppo %: Whole-field — not pull-dependent
Hot Zones: Low-middle + inner-middle
Cold Zones: High fastballs; chase breaking balls early in count
High/Low Zone Effectiveness: Much better vs. low pitches — matches swing path

Summary:
A rare AAA prospect not reliant on pull power. His whole-field distribution projects well for MLB parks.

⸻

BASERUNNING

Sprint Speed: Average
First-to-Third%: Above-average instincts
Steal Jumps Quality: Not a stolen-base threat, but smart baserunner

⸻

DEFENSE (3B / 1B)

OAA: Below MLB average at 3B; neutral at 1B
Arm Strength: Above average — one of his best defensive tools
Range Rating: Limited lateral quickness
Route Efficiency: Sufficient

Summary:
He’s not a true third baseman at the highest level yet — but his arm strength keeps him viable there. Long-term MLB home may be 1B with spot 3B starts unless range improves.

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Launch-angle correction is REAL — this is not noise.
• Expected slugging jumps dramatically when he elevates low pitches.
• Contact skill + durability = high floor.
• AAA data shows dramatic improvement vs. RHP.
• Eligible for Rule 5 means front office must plan now.
• MLB-ready? 90% bat, 60% glove, 100% durability.

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“Quintero hits the ball like he’s angry at it — but STILL doesn’t elevate enough. Fix the lift and he’s a 25-HR guy. Don’t fix it, and he’s a doubles merchant with great vibes. I love the kid. Bench someone and call him up already.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“A whole-field hitter with emerging power is a familiar story in Oakland history, one that often blooms late. The durability recalls quietly consistent players from past eras, the kind who outlast expectations and become foundational.”
