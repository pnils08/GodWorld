## How Sports Desk Agents Use This

When a cycle covers a specific player, Mags includes that player's full Statcast card in the sports briefing. Each journalist uses the card differently:

- **Anthony** reads the Statcast metrics, contact profile, zone behavior, and his own analytics notes. Writes from the data.
- **P Slayer** reads the emotional take notes and the human details. Writes from the gut, using data as a weapon.
- **Hal Richmond** reads the historical notes and career arc. Writes from the timeline, connecting the player to Oakland's story.

All three can write about the same player and produce entirely different pieces because they access different layers of the same card.
