PAULSON RETURNS TO OAKLAND: “THIS IS HOME”

GM faces city for first time since walkout, reveals Osei hospitalized after traffic collision

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

OAKLAND — Mike Paulson stood at an Oakland podium for the first time since walking out of one three cycles ago. He didn’t hide from it.

“I’d like to address this off the bat and just express my regret on how I reacted to the situation,” Paulson said. “I acted poorly in the moment and Oakland citizens certainly deserve more than that.”

The GM, fresh off an NBA Cup championship in Chicago and a preliminary stadium agreement for the Baylight District, faced the Oakland media room Tuesday with something that had been missing since the health crisis debacle: directness.

“I shouldn’t have made predictions on the health crisis and been overly enthusiastic about an end to it,” Paulson continued. “The line of questioning turned to how I knew this when I should’ve just kept my support to the medical community and not minimized the situation with a prediction.”

But the apology wasn’t the only news.

Paulson revealed that Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei — the city’s lead stadium negotiator who has been absent since Cycle 72 — was hospitalized following a traffic collision. It was the first public confirmation of what happened to the civic official whose silence had fueled weeks of speculation.

“Marcus is a very close friend and news has been scarce on his situation, but I’ve been in contact and he wanted me to share an update,” Paulson said. “He’s on the mend and doing some recovery. That’s about all I can share right now.”

Osei, Paulson added, is already trying to work from his hospital bed. “He’s a tough one.”

The presser covered baseball, the stadium, the health crisis, and the fundamental question that has followed Paulson across two cities: Where does he actually belong?

His answer was unambiguous.

“Oakland is home. This is where I plan to raise my family and retire someday.”

PAULSON ON SEYMOUR: “I’M A HUGE FAN”

GM pushes back on absence narrative, reveals three-day weekly Mesa schedule

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Mike Paulson wants to correct the record on Deacon Seymour — and on his own whereabouts.

“I’m a huge fan of Deacon,” Paulson said Tuesday. “I understand the concerns but I’m confident in his abilities. I couple that with having a young nucleus that’s ready to win.”

Then came the pushback.

“It’s untrue to suggest I have not been to Mesa. I am able to manage my time effectively to be in Mesa three days a week and Chicago three days a week. Of course my office is with me seven days.”

The travel schedule — three days Oakland/Mesa, three days Chicago, office always on — hasn’t been publicly reported before. It suggests a more hands-on approach than critics assumed during Paulson’s extended Chicago visibility around the Bulls’ championship run.

“Time will tell on that story and I understand the concerns,” Paulson acknowledged. “We are taking all precautions to ensure success.”

On the roster, Paulson pointed to pitching depth as the key difference between this year and the ALCS loss to Boston.

“We played too many games these past playoffs where the offense was carrying the load. A lot of 8 to 9 run games. If we limit some of those, the 7 we score looks a lot better.”

The offseason moves — adding Travis Coles as a second ace, bringing Benji Dillon back for the five spot, acquiring a young closer and a top-20 pitching prospect — were designed to address exactly that weakness.

“The truth of the matter is we have more depth in the farm than the roster. This offseason we escalated a few positions is all. The bullpen is uber talented so we just have to get the mix set even if that means making moves in season.”

Spring training opens against San Diego. Seymour’s first professional game is days away. Paulson says he’ll be there.

PAULSON BACKS HORN: “BEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE”

GM endorses center fielder’s bold claim

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Danny Horn said he’s the best player in baseball. His GM agrees.

“Horn is a perfectionist so it’s on par to make those claims — if he doesn’t believe it then it can’t be true,” Paulson said Tuesday. “I do agree with Horn being the most talented athlete and all-around best player in the league.”

Horn’s 2040 numbers support the argument: .280 average, 32 home runs, 98 RBIs, 35 stolen bases, .524 slugging, .879 OPS, 8.0 WAR. The 30-30 club is exclusive. The 32-35 club barely exists.

Asked how the organization manages that kind of confidence in a clubhouse with veterans like Vinnie Keane and Benji Dillon, Paulson was direct.

“We try to manage winning, and winning backs down to no one.”

KEANE’S FINAL SEASON — AND A DYNASTY CELEBRATION

Paulson announces plans to honor championship era throughout 2041

By Mags Corliss | Bay Tribune Sports

Vinnie Keane’s farewell tour just got bigger.

Mike Paulson announced Tuesday that the A’s will dedicate the 2041 season to honoring Keane’s final year — and the dynasty he helped build. But the celebration won’t stop at the third baseman.

“We will also be doing some stuff for Benji,” Paulson said, referring to pitcher Benji Dillon, who returned this offseason on a one-year, $13 million deal. “We will be bringing older players from those runs and honoring it all. The vision that’s clear to all — we are showing the youth what the expectation is.”

When asked if the season constitutes a farewell tour for Dillon as well, Paulson stopped short of confirming.

“I wouldn’t call it a farewell, but we will be honoring the dynasty with Keane’s retirement, so naturally Benji will be a part of that.”

On Keane’s future beyond playing, Paulson left the door wide open.

“Vinnie is a man of many fames as we all know, so he most definitely will have all his options available to him. I’m sure he could play a few more years if he wanted to. We’d love to have Vinnie here but may be too hard to keep him from the national media camera.”

The dynasty celebration — featuring returns from championship-era players — will mark the first time the organization has formally honored the six-title run while core members are still active.

OSEI HOSPITALIZED AFTER TRAFFIC COLLISION — PAULSON CONFIRMS

Deputy Mayor “on the mend” after weeks of public silence

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

The silence on Marcus Osei is broken.

Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei, the city’s lead economic development official and primary stadium negotiator, has been hospitalized since Cycle 72 following a traffic collision, GM Mike Paulson confirmed Tuesday.

“Marcus is a very close friend and news has been scarce on his situation, but I’ve been in contact and he wanted me to share an update,” Paulson said during his Oakland press availability. “Marcus was in a traffic collision and has been hospitalized for a few cycles now. He’s on the mend and doing some recovery.”

Paulson described Osei as “a tough one” who is already attempting to work from his hospital bed despite his condition.

The confirmation ends weeks of speculation about the deputy mayor’s absence. City officials had listed Osei as being in “serious condition” without elaboration, leading to questions about whether his absence would affect the Baylight District stadium negotiations.

Paulson credited multiple figures for keeping the deal on track during Osei’s absence.

“The Mayor has been a huge advocate for the project, and a lesser-known hero on this is Mark Aitken,” Paulson said, referring to the A’s third baseman who was recently named an MLBPA association representative. “I will tell you Mark is a future politician.”

The Baylight agreement now advances to the City Planning Committee. Paulson expressed confidence despite the civic office operating at reduced capacity.

“This has been in the works for some time so the structure has been mostly in place. That said, we would most definitely benefit from being at full strength, but like our teams, sometimes you have to make do with who’s available.”

No update was provided on Elliott Crane, the Business Caucus Leader who has also been listed as injured since Cycle 72. Paulson said only that “we expect to have him back at work soon.”

BAYLIGHT DISTRICT: “THE FANS WANTING IT IS THE BIGGEST REASON”

Paulson outlines stadium philosophy, ties success to city prosperity

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

The A’s aren’t asking for Oakland’s money. They’re asking for Oakland’s belief.

Mike Paulson outlined the Baylight District philosophy Tuesday, emphasizing that the franchise is seeking tax exemptions rather than public funding — and tying the stadium’s success directly to the city’s economic health.

“We always saw Oakland as home,” Paulson said. “When the Las Vegas deal fell through, we were pleased to be able to play in the Arizona Diamondbacks stadium, but now we are ready to take Oakland back.”

The preliminary agreement, announced alongside Mayor Avery Santana earlier this cycle, requires no direct public investment. Instead, the A’s are seeking variable tax exemptions that would scale with city performance.

“We feel the tax plan is fair and we are not looking for a set rate,” Paulson explained. “We believe this plan is more in line with the city’s success than the franchise’s.”

The framing is notable: rather than asking Oakland to subsidize a stadium, the A’s are positioning their tax relief as aligned with broader civic prosperity. If Oakland thrives, the exemptions matter less. If Oakland struggles, the franchise shares the burden.

When asked about a backup plan if the City Planning Committee rejects the proposal, Paulson declined to entertain the scenario — suggesting the organization views this as the only viable path.

On the question of jobs and timeline, Paulson pushed back against the notion that benefits are years away.

“A stadium may be a couple years away but the jobs are not. As soon as we are able, shovels are hitting dirt. Stimulation starts.”

PAULSON ON TEMESCAL: “WE STAND READY AS A PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY”

A’s announce hospital visits, awareness campaign — no predictions this time

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Bay Tribune Health Desk

Mike Paulson addressed the Temescal health crisis for the first time since his walkout — and this time, he stayed in his lane.

“As a resident of Oakland, I too am concerned and focused on what I can do to help start getting some resolve and understanding,” Paulson said Tuesday. “I think the part that has people worried is the unknown nature of the crisis.”

No predictions. No timelines. No speculation about when it might end.

Instead, Paulson praised the medical community’s response: “They have done a brilliant job keeping the cases from escalating in severity.”

And he announced concrete organizational action.

“We will have players visiting local hospitals and clinics. We also will be running informative media spots featuring players to raise awareness. We stand by ready and willing to do our part as a pillar of the community.”

The health crisis in Temescal is entering its fifth week. Community mutual aid networks have formed in the absence of official answers about causes or timeline. The arc strength remains elevated. Clinics continue monitoring.

Paulson’s response Tuesday — supportive without overstepping, concrete without predicting — stood in stark contrast to the presser that caused his walkout. He’s learned something.

Whether it’s enough for Temescal remains to be seen.

OPINION
############################################################

HE CAME BACK

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

He apologized to me.

Not to the room. To me. By name. For walking out on my question.

“P, I’m surprised you’re letting me off the hook on the health crisis fiasco. I know I walked out on your questioning and honestly I’m most ashamed of that. You are the heart of the city’s passion and I didn’t honor that. I sincerely apologize.”

I’ve been doing this job a long time. I’ve asked hard questions of owners, GMs, managers, players. I’ve been ignored. I’ve been dismissed. I’ve been cursed at once or twice. I’ve never had someone come back to a podium and apologize directly for how they treated me in a previous presser.

I don’t know what to do with that.

So I asked him what I really wanted to know: What are you chasing? You have everything. Six rings. A basketball trophy. A stadium deal. What gets you out of bed?

“I’m chasing greatness each day. That may sound cheesy but it’s a true statement. Specifically I want to make a positive impact on people I interact with and on a larger scale impact on the cities I’m working with.”

He connected it back to the walkout. Said the health crisis overreach came from the same place — wanting to impact the city, believing in the medical community, getting too excited about good news. “But I learned a valuable lesson of the damage I can do as well.”

Here’s what I know: Mike Paulson is complicated. He builds things. He breaks things. He wins championships in one city while another city wonders if he’s paying attention. He makes promises about shovels and jobs and being present three days a week.

Here’s what I don’t know: Whether the apology is the beginning of something or just a really good press conference.

But he came back. He faced the room. He said the words to my face.

That’s not nothing.

THE QUOTE THAT MATTERS

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports — Senior Historian

I’ve covered Mike Paulson for years. I’ve heard him talk about championships, rotations, player development, organizational philosophy. I’ve watched him build a dynasty and navigate its complications.

Tuesday, he said something I haven’t heard before.

“Oakland is home. This is where I plan to raise my family and retire someday.”

In all the pressers, all the availabilities, all the sidebar conversations — I don’t recall Paulson ever framing Oakland as his personal future. The franchise’s home, yes. The organization’s commitment, yes. But his family? His retirement?

That’s different.

Maybe it’s just a good line. Maybe it’s what you say when you’ve spent months in Chicago and need to reassure the city that traded you its attention. Maybe it’s politics.

But I’ve been around long enough to know when someone means something. And when Anthony asked him point-blank — “Are you back? Is this home again?” — Paulson didn’t hesitate.

The dynasty celebration he announced will bring back championship-era players. Keane gets his farewell. Dillon gets honored. The youth get shown what the expectation is.

That’s not a GM passing through. That’s a GM planting flags.

We’ll see if the flag holds.
