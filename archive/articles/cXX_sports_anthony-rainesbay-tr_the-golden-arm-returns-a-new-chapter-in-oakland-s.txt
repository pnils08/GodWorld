The Golden Arm Returns: A New Chapter in Oakland’s Story
By Anthony RainesBay Tribune A’s InsiderNovember 21, 2040
The Oakland Athletics offseason began with whispers and ended with a roar heard across the Bay.
Benji Dillon is coming home.
The left-hander who defined an era—four Cy Young Awards, six championship rings, 3,219 career strikeouts—has signed a one-year, $24.07 million contract to rejoin the franchise where his legend was forged. At 36 years old, with fifteen seasons of service time and a resume that reads like Oakland royalty, Dillon returns not as a nostalgic victory lap, but as a stabilizing force for a rotation in transition.
“Holy Toledo! I’m signing with the Athletics!” Dillon announced, his trademark exuberance intact even after all these years.
The move addresses a critical gap created by the trade of John Brever to Texas earlier this month. Brever, 31, and closer William Tata were shipped out in a salary-clearing deal that netted Oakland two high-upside prospects: 19-year-old left-hander Clemente Lopez and 18-year-old center fielder Robby Boston. The front office called it a “youth infusion strategy.” The fanbase called it the end of an era.
Dillon’s return rewrites that narrative.
A Rotation Rebuilt Around Experience
The 2040 starting rotation now features a blend of veteran command and emerging talent:
1. Henry Rivas (91 OVR) – The ace. Rivas has anchored this staff since 2036, throwing power with surgical precision. He remains Oakland’s most reliable arm.
2. Arturo Ramos (86 OVR) – The All-Star righty with a rising fastball and mid-career composure. Ramos has quietly become one of the league’s most dependable number-two starters.
3. Allen Lopez (84 OVR) – The 2038 Rookie of the Year and workhorse. Lopez posted a 2.32 ERA that season and remains a model of consistency, though his 4.27 ERA in 2039 showed some regression.
4. Benji Dillon (82 OVR) – The returning legend. No longer the flamethrower who struck out 264 batters in his 2028 Cy Young campaign, but still a master of sequencing and control. His 4.29 ERA last season suggested decline, but his postseason experience is irreplaceable.
5. John Ellis (80 OVR) – “The Quiet Storm.” The 28-year-old rookie phenom represents Oakland’s future. With a fastball that touches the mid-90s and composure beyond his years, Ellis now learns from the man whose path he hopes to follow.
More Than Numbers
This isn’t just about filling a rotation slot. Dillon’s return carries symbolic weight that transcends his current velocity readings.
He was there for the dynasty’s apex—the 2027, 2028, 2030, 2031, 2034, and 2037 championships. He stood beside Vinnie Keane when the underdog slugger won MVP in 2031. He mentored Mark Aitken through his Rookie of the Year campaign in 2032. He outlasted the rebuild and watched Darrin Davis claim MVP honors in 2037, the franchise’s final championship before the current transition.
Now he returns to a clubhouse that includes José Colón, Danny Horn, Vladimir Gonzalez, and Martin Richards—players who grew up watching Dillon dominate October. His presence alone shifts the culture.
“Benji’s not just a pitcher,” one front office source told the Tribune. “He’s institutional memory in cleats.”
The Brever Trade Context
To understand Dillon’s signing, you must understand what Oakland lost in the Brever deal.
John Brever—85 overall, B potential, 31 years old—was shipped to Texas alongside closer William Tata in exchange for Clemente Lopez and Robby Boston. The deal cleared $24.18 million in salary obligations and signaled Oakland’s commitment to long-term flexibility over short-term contention.
Brever’s regression curve made him expendable. But his departure left a leadership void that statistics couldn’t measure. Dillon fills that void while providing Oakland with a veteran bridge to the Ellis era.
Lopez, the key return piece, projects as a future top-of-rotation arm. But he’s 19 years old. He’s not ready. Dillon is.
Bullpen Reinforcements
The Athletics didn’t stop with Dillon. Oakland also acquired Louis Cross (88 OVR, left-handed reliever) from Washington in exchange for reliever Johnny Carter and outfielder Craig Miller. Cross brings late-inning velocity—96 mph fastball—and posted a 2.13 ERA across 72 innings in 2039. His $12 million AAV contract runs through 2044.
Oakland also added Steve Veras, a low-cost bullpen option from San Francisco, in exchange for Troy William, Dave Mullins, and Armando Marquez. At $650,000, Veras represents depth and flexibility for midseason call-ups.
Meanwhile, the A’s sent catcher Henry Calzado to Baltimore in exchange for outfielder Julian Porcelli—a minor organizational depth move designed to address catching depth and clear roster congestion.
What This Means
Oakland’s offseason strategy is clear: remain competitive in 2040 while building for 2042 and beyond.
Dillon provides immediate rotation stability. Cross shores up the bullpen. And the Brever trade ensures that Oakland’s farm system—already ranked among the league’s best—continues to ascend.
The 2040 Athletics won’t be the juggernaut that won six titles in eleven years. But they won’t be irrelevant either. Not with Rivas at the top, Ramos in support, and Benji Dillon proving that legends don’t just fade—they return when needed most.
