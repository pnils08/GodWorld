LEAGUE NOTE: ZERO MOVEMENT EXPECTED FOR OAKLAND THIS WEEK

League sources describe the Athletics’ front office as “unusually quiet” this cycle. No calls logged on potential trades. No internal movement under consideration. No discussions about waivers or cuts.

The preference, according to individuals familiar with the matter:
maintain roster stability during what has been one of the calmest performance periods of the season.

Nothing appears imminent.
