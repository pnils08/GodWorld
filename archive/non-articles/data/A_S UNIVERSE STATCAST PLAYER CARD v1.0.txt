PITCHING REPERTOIRE — SAVANT INTERPRETATION

4-Seam Fastball — 93 mph
• Ride over the top
• Late hop effect
• Generates weak fly balls
• Command-first heater, not a blow-by weapon

Slider — 86 mph
• Wipeout when tunneled properly
• Hard, gyro shape
• Generates chase swings from RHB
• Best miss-generator in arsenal

Curveball — 78 mph
• Sentimental “Puerto Rican pitching school” shape
• Large vertical depth
• Early-count strike stealer
• Works beautifully off slider velocity gap

Summary:
A three-pitch ace starter —
two strikeout weapons + one elite sequencing tool.

⸻

DEFENSE & ATHLETICS

Fielding: Average
Arm Strength: Good
Pickoff Move: Above-average
Reaction: Fine

No weaknesses, no standout strengths —
he does not hurt himself defensively.

⸻

DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY

He’s young.
He’s durable.
He’s command-first.
He has two real strikeout pitches.
This combination is extremely rare.

Projection Curve:
• 2024–2026: SP2/low-end SP1
• 2027–2030: Clear SP1 window
• Long-term durability: Very strong

In plain English:
He’s going to be a top-five pitcher in your league for a long time.

⸻

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Ramos’s slider tunnels so cleanly off his four-seam that hitters misread the pitch for 25–30 feet.
• Low walk rate is the SINGLE most important trait for sustainable pitching — he’s elite already.
• HR rate is his only flaw, and that improves with location refinement.
• Strikeout totals will rise naturally as he learns to sequence for kill counts.
• Long-term WAR projection rivals Benji Dillon’s early-career curve.

⸻

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“He pitches like someone who knows he belongs on a big stage.
Not scared of anyone.
Not overwhelmed by anything.
Ramos shows up like the moment owes him something.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Pitchers like Ramos used to be called ‘control artists.’
Today, they are engines of dynasties.
His rookie year stands alongside the great debuts of Oakland’s long, winding history.”
