TEMESCAL GETS ITS ANSWER: $48M HEALTH CENTER PROPOSED FOR TELEGRAPH CORRIDOR

First rendering shows 42,000 sq ft facility with urgent care, behavioral health, disease surveillance

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Bay Tribune Health Desk

OAKLAND — The city has finally named what Temescal has been waiting for.

The Oakland Department of Health & Human Services released a full proposal Thursday for the Temescal Community Health Center — a 42,000 square foot neighborhood health facility that would bring primary care, urgent care, behavioral health services, and disease surveillance capacity to a district that currently has none.

The rendering shows a two-story facility on Telegraph Avenue, its facade warm against an evening sky. Healthcare workers in scrubs cluster near the entrance. A mobile health van sits ready in a side bay. Signage lists services: Primary Care, Women’s Health, Pediatrics, Behavioral Health. The building looks permanent — built to last, not improvised.

“This isn’t a response to Wave 4,” said a Health Department spokesperson. “This is a recognition that a neighborhood of this density cannot function without healthcare infrastructure that matches its population.”

The numbers are significant: $48 million total investment, drawn from city general funds ($18M), Alameda County Health Services ($12M), state grants ($8M), federal programs ($6M), and private foundation matching ($4M). Seventy-two full-time staff positions. Capacity for 58,000 annual patient visits by Year 3.

The facility would include 12 primary care exam rooms, an 8-bay urgent care wing with extended hours (7am-11pm), a behavioral health suite with crisis stabilization capacity, dedicated pediatric and women’s health clinics, and — critically — a disease surveillance lab capable of sample collection and preliminary testing.

That last item speaks directly to the current crisis. When Wave 4 symptoms began appearing in Temescal, samples had to be transported to County facilities for analysis. The Community Health Center would eliminate that gap.

The approval pathway is long: site selection through Cycle 78, Council budget appropriation in Cycle 80, County partnership agreement in Cycle 82, environmental review through Cycle 88, construction start in Year 3, and facility opening in Year 3 Q4.

But the proposal is real. The rendering is public. And Temescal, for the first time in five weeks of health crisis, has something concrete to point to.

WHAT THE PICTURE SHOWS: A FACILITY BUILT FOR PERMANENCE

Visual analysis of the Temescal Community Health Center rendering

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

OAKLAND — The rendering tells a story of intention.

The Temescal Community Health Center appears in evening light — the kind of warm, golden-hour glow that makes buildings feel welcoming rather than institutional. The design is modern but grounded: a two-story structure with a mix of materials — concrete base, wood-toned upper panels, large glass windows that let light in and let activity be visible from the street.

The building sits integrated into the Telegraph Avenue corridor, not isolated from it. Trees line the sidewalk. Benches invite sitting. The urban design suggests a facility that wants to be part of the neighborhood, not apart from it.

At street level, the entrance is wide and accessible, with healthcare workers visible both inside and outside the building. The rendering shows staff in scrubs talking with community members — the visual language of a facility that serves rather than processes.

A mobile health van sits in a dedicated bay to the right of the main entrance. The proposal mentions two vans serving adjacent neighborhoods — Rockridge, Longfellow, Santa Fe, Piedmont Avenue. The van in the rendering looks ready to deploy.

The signage is clear but not overwhelming. “Temescal Community Health Center” in large letters across the top. Below, service categories: “Primary Care,” “Women’s Health,” “Pediatrics,” “Behavioral Health.” The message: this facility does many things, and it wants you to know what they are.

Perhaps most striking: the people. The rendering is full of them — families with children, elderly residents on benches, cyclists passing on the bike lane, staff in scrubs, patients arriving and leaving. This isn’t a picture of a building. It’s a picture of a building in use, surrounded by life, embedded in community.

The hills of Oakland rise in the background, a reminder that this facility would serve not just Temescal but the neighborhoods climbing up toward the ridge.

One rendering doesn’t build a health center. But it shows what the city is imagining — and what Temescal has been asking for.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE

“THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED”: TEMESCAL RESIDENTS REACT TO HEALTH CENTER PROPOSAL

Voices from the neighborhood that’s been waiting for answers

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Investigations

TEMESCAL — The rendering dropped Thursday afternoon. By evening, the neighborhood was talking.

The Bay Tribune spoke with Temescal residents about the Community Health Center proposal — what it means, what it promises, and whether they believe it will happen.

-----

**Ariana Lee, 26, Temescal** — *Serious health condition diagnosed during Wave 4*

“I’ve been sick since early winter. Nobody can tell me exactly what’s wrong — the tests come back unclear, the symptoms don’t match anything specific. I’ve been to three different clinics, all of them miles away, all of them with weeks-long wait times.

“When I saw that rendering, I cried. I’m not kidding. A place I could walk to. Urgent care that’s open until 11pm. A behavioral health suite — because whatever this is, it’s affecting my mind too, not just my body.

“I don’t know if it’ll be built in time to help me. The timeline says Year 3. But knowing it’s coming? Knowing someone is finally building something permanent? That matters. That’s not nothing.”

-----

**Marcus Nguyen, 27, Temescal** — *Recent arrival, moved to Oakland Cycle 72*

“I moved here two months ago. Within weeks, everyone was talking about the health crisis — symptoms no one could explain, clinics at capacity, mutual aid networks filling gaps that should be filled by institutions.

“I kept thinking: why isn’t there a health center here? The neighborhood is dense. The demand is obvious. The crisis made it visible, but the need existed before.

“The proposal makes sense. $48 million is real money, but look at what they’re promising — 58,000 patient visits a year, 72 jobs, half of them Oakland residents. A disease surveillance lab so the next crisis doesn’t catch everyone off guard.

“I’ll believe it when I see construction start. But the fact that they’re talking about it publicly, with a rendering and a timeline — that’s more than I expected.”

-----

**Brianna Harris, 48, Temescal** — *Long-term resident, quoted in Edition 74*

“I’ve lived here twenty years. I’ve watched three different health facilities get proposed for this corridor. None of them got built. Budget cuts, political fights, site disputes — there’s always a reason.

“So when I saw the rendering, my first thought wasn’t ‘finally.’ It was ‘here we go again.’

“But this proposal is different. The funding is layered — city, county, state, federal, private. That’s harder to kill. The timeline is specific. The rendering looks like they actually talked to an architect.

“I want to be hopeful. My neighbor is still dealing with symptoms. The clinic I use is still booking three weeks out. The need is real.

“But I’ll believe it when I see the Council appropriation pass. Until then, it’s a pretty picture.”

-----

**Tariq Lewis, 28, Temescal** — *Observed neighborhood tension during health crisis*

“The rendering shows a mobile health van. That’s the part that got me.

“My grandmother lives in Longfellow. No clinic within walking distance. When she gets sick, we drive her to Highland or we wait. Those are the options.

“A mobile van that serves adjacent neighborhoods — that’s not just Temescal getting a facility. That’s the whole corridor getting access. Longfellow. Santa Fe. Shafter. The neighborhoods that always get overlooked.

“If they build this, and the vans actually deploy, that changes healthcare for thousands of people who don’t live in Temescal but don’t have anything closer.

“That’s worth fighting for.”

-----

**Elena Lopez, 51, Fruitvale** — *Attended Community Action Day*

“I don’t live in Temescal. I live in Fruitvale. But when I heard about the health center proposal, I had two thoughts:

“First: good. That neighborhood needs it. The crisis showed everyone what happens when infrastructure doesn’t match population.

“Second: why Temescal first? What about Fruitvale? What about West Oakland? What about the neighborhoods that have been underserved longer, with less political power to demand attention?

“I’m not against this proposal. I hope it passes. But I hope the city remembers that Temescal isn’t the only neighborhood that needs healthcare infrastructure. Don’t build one center and call it done.”

POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

THE VOTES THAT MATTER: HEALTH CENTER FACES BUDGET BATTLE

$18M general fund ask lands during constraint period

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

OAKLAND — The Temescal Community Health Center proposal includes $48 million in funding — but only $18 million of it requires City Council approval. That $18 million is where the fight will happen.

The political landscape is complicated.

**OPP (Oakland Progressive Party)** council members are expected to support the proposal. Health equity is a caucus priority, and the Temescal crisis has made infrastructure gaps impossible to ignore. Caucus Leader Janae Rivers has not yet commented publicly, but sources indicate strong support.

**CRC (Civic Responsibility Coalition)** members are skeptical. The $18 million general fund ask arrives during a period of budget constraint — the same period when the Baylight District is seeking tax exemptions and multiple city departments are facing cuts. Business Caucus Leader Elliott Crane, who might have led opposition, remains hospitalized.

**Council President Ramon Vega** has not indicated his position. Vega is considered a swing vote on fiscal matters, balancing progressive priorities against budget realities.

The arithmetic matters: Council appropriation requires a 5-4 majority. With Crane hospitalized and several seats vacant, the margin is razor-thin.

Mayor Avery Santana has not publicly endorsed the proposal but has consistently supported health infrastructure investment. A mayoral endorsement could shift momentum.

The timeline provides some runway: budget appropriation isn’t scheduled until Cycle 80. That gives advocates time to build support — and opponents time to organize.

For now, the proposal exists. The rendering is public. The numbers are on the table.

The votes come later.

OPINION
############################################################

THE BUILDING THAT SHOULD HAVE EXISTED

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports — Senior Historian

I’ve covered Oakland for forty years. I’ve seen facilities proposed, debated, funded, defunded, redesigned, abandoned, and occasionally built.

The Temescal Community Health Center is different.

Not because the proposal is better — though it is detailed and thoughtfully designed. Not because the rendering is prettier — though it shows a facility that looks like it belongs on Telegraph Avenue. Not even because the funding is more secure — though the layered approach makes it harder to kill.

It’s different because we can all see, right now, in real time, what happens when this facility doesn’t exist.

Wave 4 showed us. Five weeks of unexplained symptoms. Clinics at capacity. Three-week waits for new patients. No local disease surveillance — samples shipped to County for analysis. Mutual aid networks filling gaps that should be filled by institutions.

The rendering shows what could have been there. What should have been there. What wasn’t.

That’s not a criticism of the proposal. It’s an explanation of why this proposal matters more than the three previous health center proposals that died in committee rooms over the past two decades.

We can see the gap now. It’s not theoretical. It’s not a budget line item to be debated in the abstract. It’s neighbors organizing meal trains because clinics are overwhelmed.

The Temescal Community Health Center is a $48 million proposal that should have been built twenty years ago. The fact that it might finally happen isn’t a triumph. It’s a recognition of failure — a city admitting that infrastructure lagged behind population, that planning lagged behind need, that the crisis was predictable and the response was not.

Build it. Fund it. Staff it. And then build the next one in Fruitvale, and the one after that in West Oakland, and keep building until every neighborhood has what Temescal is finally being offered.

The rendering is beautiful. The need is urgent. The gap is visible.

Close it.

THE QUESTION NOBODY’S ANSWERING

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

The rendering is gorgeous. The proposal is detailed. The funding is layered. The timeline is specific.

And nobody’s talking about Wave 4.

I read the whole proposal. Forty-two thousand square feet. Disease surveillance lab. Emergency operations room. Behavioral health suite. Everything you’d want in a health center designed for a neighborhood that just experienced an unexplained health crisis.

But the proposal doesn’t explain the crisis. It doesn’t even try.

“The Wave 4 health event in Temescal has exposed gaps in neighborhood health infrastructure.” That’s the only reference. Exposed gaps. Not explained symptoms. Not identified cause. Not resolved outbreak.

Exposed gaps.

I’m not against this health center. I want it built. I want the 72 jobs and the 58,000 patient visits and the mobile vans serving Longfellow and Santa Fe. I want Ariana Lee, 26, serious condition diagnosed, to have somewhere to walk to when she needs care.

But I also want to know what’s making people sick.

The proposal says the health center “does not solve the current outbreak.” It says the facility “ensures the next health event — whatever form it takes — meets an institutional response rather than improvised mutual aid.”

Whatever form it takes. The next health event.

What about this one?

We’re building a $48 million facility to prepare for the next crisis. Are we going to explain the current one first?

I don’t know. And from what I can tell, neither does anyone else.

Build the health center. But don’t pretend the building answers the question.

LETTERS FROM READERS

*Submitted following health center proposal release:*

-----

**“Finally, something real”**

I’ve been watching my neighbors get sick for five weeks. The mutual aid network I joined has delivered 47 meals to households dealing with Wave 4 symptoms. We’ve been organizing what the city should have organized.

Now there’s a proposal. A building. A timeline. It’s not fast enough — Year 3 opening when people are sick now — but it’s real. After weeks of nothing but unanswered questions, we have something to fight for.

— Sofia Carter, 34, Temescal

-----

**“Where’s the money for schools?”**

$18 million from the general fund for a health center. Meanwhile, Oakland Unified is facing cuts and Temescal schools are losing staff.

I want healthcare infrastructure. I also want my kids to have teachers. Can we fund both? Or do we only care about health crises when they make the news?

— Tobias Scott, 30, Temescal

-----

**“The mobile vans matter most”**

Everyone’s talking about the building. I’m focused on page 3: “Mobile Unit Garage: Housing for 2 mobile health vans serving adjacent neighborhoods.”

I live in Longfellow. No clinic within a mile. When my son gets sick, we drive to Highland or we wait. A mobile van that comes to us — that’s not a luxury. That’s basic access.

Build the center. But deploy the vans first.

— Carlos Jackson, 33, West Oakland

-----

**“Don’t forget who fills the gaps”**

The proposal mentions “improvised mutual aid” as something to move past. I organized that mutual aid. My neighbors organized it. We’re the reason people got meals, got rides to clinics, got information when the city provided none.

Build the health center. But don’t pretend institutions would have responded without the community showing them how.
