VINNIE KEANE — The Underdog Slugger
P Slayer: What tells you your swing showed up today?
Keane: “If pine tar smells sweet and the barrel feels heavy—I’m hunting gaps early.”

Mindset: Replays one childhood at‑bat in his head before stepping in.
Ritual: Tape, untape, retape the top hand once; no hat during cage work.
Stat‑meets‑soul: Pull‑side power spike after late‑day starts; credits longer shadow reads.
