Oakland Issues Its Blueprint for Fruitvale. Now Comes the Vote.

A $230 million scope release for Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II enters developer selection — the one initiative on Oakland's crowded board that is actually on track.

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

---

The Office of City Planning released the full project scope for Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II on Thursday, issuing a planning document that puts price tags, unit counts, and a seven-source financing stack behind what has until now been a promise.

The numbers are real and they are specific. Four hundred and twenty housing units on 18 acres surrounding Fruitvale BART station. Two hundred and eighty of those units — 67 percent — affordable to households earning at or below 60 percent of area median income, with deed restrictions running a minimum of 55 years. At the low end of the affordability tiers, monthly rent runs $650 to $800. For context: a one-bedroom in Fruitvale at market rate will cost you considerably more than that, and a one-bedroom in Temescal will cost you more still.

The estimated total investment is $230 million. The lead agencies are the City of Oakland and the Unity Council, which has been anchoring neighborhood development in Fruitvale since before the original Fruitvale Village opened in 2004.

The project is entering its developer selection phase. Community visioning sessions, which ran across several prior planning periods, are complete. The Planning Commission approved the conceptual plan. The BART Joint Development MOU has been negotiated. The project now goes to a Request for Proposals process, after which CEQA review begins, and then — years from now — a final council vote.

That final vote is where the money lands.

THE $22 MILLION QUESTION

The financing stack for Fruitvale Phase II draws from seven sources. The two largest are a $65 million private developer equity commitment (pending the RFP) and a $45 million state transit-oriented development grant (applied for, not yet awarded). But the political fulcrum sits at a smaller number: $22 million from the City Housing Trust Fund, which requires council appropriation as part of the final approval vote. That vote requires a simple majority — five of nine council members.

The scope release is explicit that the $22 million commitment is not separate from the final vote. It is part of the appropriation measure. The council member who votes yes on Fruitvale Phase II is voting yes on the city's Housing Trust Fund commitment at the same time. For members who represent neighborhoods competing for the same limited housing dollars, that is not a trivial calculation.

Mayor Avery Santana's office indicated support for the project in comments provided with the scope release. City Planning Director Mara Vance, who signed the release, noted that Fruitvale Phase II "adds a second major development node to Oakland's regional infrastructure network" and flagged the city's ongoing infrastructure capital gap as context for construction sequencing.

The council vote is anticipated later this year. That is an approximation, not a date. The approval pathway runs through developer selection and CEQA review before the final council question is called. Given the scale of CEQA review, residents monitoring this project should understand that "later this year" applies to planning calendar mathematics, not construction. Ground does not break until Year 4.

WHERE THIS SITS

Five major civic initiatives are now active simultaneously in Oakland. Four of them are in various stages of difficulty.

The Oakland Alternative Response Initiative, which passed on a 5-4 vote, is operating under a 45-day implementation clock that is approximately halfway expired. The Mayor's office has not named the three required pilot districts. No hiring criteria for the behavioral health teams have been released.

OARI IMPLEMENTATION CLOCK: ~Day 22 of 45. No pilot districts. No hiring criteria. No timeline.

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund, authorized five editions ago at $28 million, has disbursed zero dollars. The Office of Economic and Workforce Development is processing applications. That is the same status it had last edition and the edition before that.

STABILIZATION FUND: 5 editions. $28M authorized. $0 disbursed.

The Temescal Community Health Center passed with funding in place but exists today only as a planning document. The building does not exist. The Mayor's office has been asked about a priority designation that could compress the permitting timeline. The designation has not been issued.

The Baylight District bond authorization passed 6-3 — the strongest margin of any major initiative this year — but two financing instruments remain unsigned. Tax increment financing language was incomplete at the time of the vote. The soil remediation bonding instrument has not been executed. Construction cannot mobilize until both are signed.

Against that backdrop, Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II is the one initiative on the board coded green. Visioning complete. Conceptual plan approved. BART MOU negotiated. Scope released. Developer selection beginning.

A DIFFERENT MODEL

Phase II is not Baylight. The comparison is worth making explicitly because both projects landed in the same planning period, and the contrast is instructive.

Baylight is $2.1 billion on premium waterfront land, anchored by a professional baseball stadium, aimed at a market that includes premium amenities and significant market-rate development. Fruitvale Phase II asks whether Oakland can build neighborhood-scale, transit-oriented, majority-affordable housing in a working-class, Latino-majority community — inland, on 18 acres, without a stadium anchor and without waterfront land.

If the answer is yes, the planning commission's conceptual approval suggests it could become a replicable model at other transit nodes: East Oakland, San Antonio, Coliseum BART. If the answer is no, Baylight remains an exceptional case rather than a template.

Phase I of the same project, Fruitvale Village, opened in 2004 with 47 units of affordable housing, 40,000 square feet of retail, and community anchors including a library branch, health clinic, and senior center. Annual foot traffic now exceeds 1.2 million. BART ridership at the station rose 18 percent following completion. Phase I was designed as a pilot. Nearly four decades later, it is still the only example.

Phase II is supposed to finish what Phase I started — the full mixed-use district the original development anticipated. The scope release describes 85,000 square feet of commercial space, an expanded health clinic in partnership with La Clinica de La Raza adding 8,000 square feet, a childcare center with 80 subsidized slots, and a 1.2-acre central plaza doubling the existing public space.

The workforce numbers are explicit: 1,400 construction jobs over a four-year build, 380 permanent positions, 40 percent local hire for construction and 60 percent for permanent employment. Fifty percent of retail leases are reserved for Fruitvale-based or Latino-owned businesses.

For Calvin Turner, a mechanic who has lived in Fruitvale for years, the question is simpler than the planning documents make it sound. "I've seen this neighborhood get a lot of plans," he said Thursday. "Plans aren't the problem. It's what happens after."

What happens after, in this case, is a developer selection process, a years-long environmental review, and a council vote that has not yet been scheduled. The scope release is the first step toward the building. The building itself is in Year 4.

THE RENDERING
############################################################

The Rendering: What Fruitvale Was Always Supposed to Become

A glossy image of a future Fruitvale asks an old question: what took so long?

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture & Community

---

The first thing I noticed in the rendering was the light.

It's golden-hour light, the kind that makes everything look the way you want it to look. The BART station rises at the center, its familiar blue and white signage catching the late sun. The buildings on either side — five, maybe six stories of brick and glass, ground-floor retail open to a wide pedestrian plaza — glow warm. There are dozens of people in the image. A cyclist cuts diagonally across the frame. A yellow-orange AC Transit bus waits at the curb. On the right building, in clean white letters: COMMUNITY CENTER.

I've walked past the Fruitvale BART station on and off for more than twenty years. It doesn't look like this. But looking at the rendering, I kept thinking: it should.

Fruitvale Village opened in 2004. Forty-seven affordable housing units, a library branch, a health clinic, a senior center, forty thousand square feet of retail on what had been a surface parking lot. A million-plus people pass through annually. BART ridership at the station went up eighteen percent after it opened. The project was supposed to be a pilot — a proof of concept for what transit-oriented, majority-affordable development could look like in an Oakland working-class neighborhood.

Nearly four decades later, it's still the only example.

Phase II, now entering its developer selection stage, is meant to finally finish what Phase I started. Four hundred and twenty housing units. A central plaza that doubles in size. A paseo pedestrian network. Eighty subsidized childcare slots. An expanded health clinic, built in partnership with La Clinica de La Raza, adding eight thousand square feet. Ground-floor retail with half the leases reserved for Fruitvale-based or Latino-owned businesses.

That last detail is the one that stayed with me when I called Rafael Phillips last week.

Rafael is twenty-six and grew up in Fruitvale. He works as a server, goes to St. Columba, knows the neighborhood the way you only know a place when you've never had reason to leave it. I asked him what the retail reservation meant to him — all that language about fifty percent of leases, Fruitvale-based or Latino-owned.

"It means when I'm walking through there in five years, I'm not looking at stuff that has nothing to do with us," he said. "It means the people who already know what this neighborhood needs get to actually be there."

He paused. "If it gets built."

He said it without bitterness. It was just the empirical observation of someone who has watched Oakland announce things before.

The Unity Council has been the institutional anchor here since before Phase I. They're not just a community partner on Phase II — they're co-lead with the City, alongside their own capital campaign running toward twelve million dollars. That matters. Phase I worked, in part, because it was built from inside the neighborhood rather than delivered to it. Phase II is structured the same way. The anti-displacement commitment — thirty percent of new affordable units prioritized for current Fruitvale residents — is that same logic extended into the housing itself.

Shawn Nguyen, forty-three, has worked construction in Fruitvale for years. He drives Telegraph daily, knows where the pavement is bad, knows which blocks are going which direction. I showed him the rendering on my phone outside the station on a Tuesday afternoon.

He was quiet for a moment. He handed it back.

"I've poured foundation in this neighborhood," he said. "I've built stuff that'll outlast me. And I can't tell you I can afford to live here." He looked back at the station. "Those fourteen hundred construction jobs — I want to know who's actually getting those. I want to know if it's us."

Forty percent local hire is written into the project's workforce commitment. Whether that holds through the developer selection process and into execution is a different question. Shawn knows the answer won't come from a rendering.

The image is aspirational by design. That's its purpose. The plaza in the picture is always going to look better than the plaza that gets built, with the afternoon light always exactly right, the crowds always evenly distributed, the greenery always full and bright. Renderings are a city's way of making a promise visible — of showing people not what is, but what could be.

Oakland has shown Fruitvale a lot of renderings.

What's different now, or different enough to take seriously, is what's behind this one: the approvals that are already signed, the MOU negotiated with BART, the planning commission sign-off on the conceptual plan, the seven-source financing stack, Unity Council's hand already in the work. Phase II is the greenest light on Oakland's development board right now — not perfect, not fast, not without political risk, but real in ways it wasn't two years ago.

The golden-hour light in the image is invented. The years it took to get here are not.

The Transit Math Behind Fruitvale Phase II

A car-light development adds 420 units to a BART station. The question is whether the station — and the system behind it — can absorb what comes next.

By Trevor Shimizu | Bay Tribune Infrastructure

---

Friday morning, shortly after 7 a.m., the Fruitvale BART station handled its usual commute load: eastbound and westbound platforms, the AC Transit transfers, the pedestrian flow from International Boulevard. The station processes that load every weekday with infrastructure built for a different era's ridership numbers.

The City of Oakland's scope release for Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II dropped Thursday. The document is primarily a housing and commercial development plan — 420 units, 85,000 square feet of retail, financing stack — but buried in Section V is the infrastructure design that makes the project interesting from a systems standpoint.

Three new pedestrian entries to BART fare gates. A relocated AC Transit hub with covered waiting. Two hundred secure bike parking spaces and a bike share station. A dedicated ride-share zone. And the number that tells the design story: a parking ratio of 0.5, meaning 210 spaces for 420 units.

That last figure is the commitment. A conventional residential development at this scale would include parking ratios closer to 1.0 or higher. Phase II is building half that. The project is making a bet that residents will use BART, that they will bike, that they will take the bus — and that the design of the transit integration will make that bet rational rather than aspirational.

The upside is real. Phase I of the same development, Fruitvale Village, saw BART ridership at the station increase 18 percent following completion in 2004. Phase II, at nearly nine times the housing scale, carries a target of 25 percent ridership growth at Fruitvale station by Year 7.

The question underneath the target is the one this desk raised in the C83 Cycle Pulse: can the system behind the station handle what's coming?

THE MAINTENANCE GAP PROBLEM

Oakland's infrastructure capital budget runs at approximately $140 million annually against an identified maintenance need of roughly $200 million. That $60 million gap doesn't close by adding ridership. It compounds.

Regional transit systems running below their maintenance baseline tend to absorb growth through deferred upgrades — platforms that aren't expanded when they should be, signaling systems that run past their service interval, mechanical systems that accumulate minor failures until they produce major ones. The Fruitvale station is not in crisis. But it is part of a regional system that is not running at full capacity.

Shawn Nguyen, a construction laborer who drives Telegraph daily for work and has spent the past several years on Fruitvale job sites, looked at the scope release numbers Thursday evening. He focused on the 40 percent local hire commitment for construction — 1,400 jobs, which would represent real work for Oakland's trades workers — but his question was about the timeline. "Year 7 is a long way out," he said. "What does the station look like in three years, before any of the new housing is built? It's already crowded in the morning."

That sequencing issue is specific and worth tracking. The approval pathway for Phase II runs through developer selection (entering now), CEQA review (beginning after selection), and a final council vote — followed by construction starting in Year 4 and the first residential completion in Year 6. The BART integration improvements — the three new fare gate entries, the relocated bus hub — are part of the construction scope, meaning they arrive with the buildings, not before.

For the next several years, Fruitvale station will continue absorbing traffic without the infrastructure improvements the project promises. Whether the current station handles that interval well depends on what BART does independently of this development.

SEQUENCING WITH BAYLIGHT

The scope release acknowledges a coordination requirement the planning office did not need to mention but chose to: "The Baylight District development, which received council approval this week, will draw on the same regional transit and utility systems. Sequencing between the two projects' construction phases will require coordination."

That sentence is doing significant work. Both projects feed into the same regional transit network. Both involve construction logistics that will use Oakland's road and utility infrastructure simultaneously if their build phases overlap. Baylight's 12-year phased development clock is theoretically running — though two outstanding financing instruments mean mobilization hasn't started. Phase II's construction begins in Year 4, following CEQA review.

The overlap window is not yet defined. What the planning office is flagging is that the two largest development projects in Oakland's current pipeline are heading toward the same regional systems, and someone will need to run the sequencing math before both are simultaneously under construction.

The transit-first design of Fruitvale Phase II is part of the right answer to that pressure. If the car-light parking ratio holds — if residents actually use BART and AC Transit rather than driving — the project adds density without adding proportional road load. That is the theory. The practice depends on whether the transit infrastructure those residents rely on is maintained well enough to make the choice reliable.

Phase I proved the model works at small scale. The 18 percent ridership gain from 47 units and 40,000 square feet of retail is the evidence the planning commission relied on. Phase II is running the same test at nine times the housing density. The variables are different at that scale. So is what happens when things go wrong.

The $230 Million Question: What's Committed, What's Applied, and What's Still Being Written

Fruitvale Phase II carries a nine-figure price tag. Parsing who's actually written a check reveals a more complicated picture.

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business & Economics

---

The scope release for Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II leads with a number that lands hard: $230 million in estimated investment across 18 acres surrounding the Fruitvale BART station. It is the largest neighborhood-scale housing project Oakland has announced in a generation. But a financing stack is not a record of checks written. Walk through the seven sources and the picture sharpens considerably.

Start with what's locked. The $28 million in federal Community Development Block Grant and HOME funds is a multi-year allocation — committed. The $18 million from BART's Joint Development Program has a negotiated MOU behind it. Combined, that's $46 million in money that is not going anywhere, representing about 20 cents of every dollar in the project budget. The Unity Council's capital campaign has $12 million ongoing — that's institutional momentum, though campaigns can stall.

Now for the portion that requires things to go right. The $45 million State Transit-Oriented Development grant has been applied for, not awarded. The $40 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit equity is projected — meaning the LIHTC syndication hasn't closed. The $65 million in private developer equity comes with no developer attached yet; the RFP to find one is the exercise the project is now entering. And the $22 million City Housing Trust Fund commitment requires a separate council appropriation, meaning it passes only if five council members vote yes when the final approval comes around.

Do the arithmetic: the firm, committed money in this stack totals somewhere around $58 million. The remaining $172 million depends on a state grant decision, a tax credit close, a developer RFP outcome, a capital campaign finish line, and a future council vote. That is not a knock on the project. That is how affordable housing finance works — it is assembled in pieces, none of which arrive at the same time. But readers should know the difference between $230 million announced and $230 million in hand.

What's being bought with that money matters too. Of the project's 420 housing units, 280 will be priced below 60 percent of area median income. Eighty-five of those units carry estimated rents of $650 to $800 a month — a figure that, in Oakland's current rental market, might as well be from another era. Deed restrictions run a minimum of 55 years, which means those rents don't float away the moment conditions improve. Current Fruitvale residents get priority access to 30 percent of the new affordable units, a structural anti-displacement mechanism built directly into the approval.

On the labor side: 1,400 construction jobs over a four-year build, with a 40 percent local hire requirement. Those jobs feed into the Oakland Youth Apprenticeship Pipeline — the same trade pathways now attached to the Baylight project, though on a different scale entirely. Baylight is a $2.1 billion waterfront authorization. Fruitvale is $230 million in Fruitvale. The apprenticeship connection is meaningful either way: a young electrician from Temescal logging hours on Phase II is building toward credentials that transfer to any major site in the region.

Jose Wright, 26, an electrician based in Temescal who has been tracking the Fruitvale project, offered a measured take. He didn't live through Phase I's construction — he was in elementary school when Fruitvale Village opened. But he noticed something when the Health Center vote passed two years ago and the building still hasn't broken ground. "They vote it, they announce it, and then nothing moves for years," he said. "I'm not celebrating Fruitvale Phase II until I see a shovel. Even then, I want to know what the local hire process actually looks like — not the number in the document."

That skepticism is worth sitting with. The $22 million Housing Trust Fund commitment is the city's actual new dollar in this deal — and it requires a council vote that hasn't happened. Everything else in the stack is either pre-existing, applied for, or contingent on a developer the city hasn't selected. The project is on track. The money is still being assembled.

Post-Vote Market Signals at the Baylight Site Raise Questions About Scope

A feasibility abstract circulating in investment channels, a closed walkthrough, and drone imagery combine to create a picture the city hasn't addressed.

By Reed Thompson | Bay Tribune Wire

---

OAKLAND — Financial and investment channels circulating late in the week following the 6-3 Baylight District bond authorization reference a private feasibility abstract titled "Indoor Premium Event Venue — Market Elasticity Review." The document, reportedly six pages, carries no league marks and no team names. Capacity modeling in the abstract ranges from 18,000 to 20,000 seats in enclosed configuration.

The document's language, according to channel references, focuses on concert market undersupply along the West Coast, indoor event routing inefficiencies, broadcast revenue multipliers, and waterfront district activation outside the baseball season.

Within 72 hours of the council vote, two hospitality operators confirmed attendance at a post-bond walkthrough of the waterfront site. Investor presence was noted. No press access was granted. No filing was made with City Hall in connection with the walkthrough.

Separately, drone imagery posted to investment channels appears to show a second circular massing outline chalked into the ground inland from the approved stadium bowl. The placement does not interrupt the waterfront axis established in the approved project plans. A lower roofline is suggested by the outline's scale relative to the stadium bowl. Shared infrastructure is implied by the outline's positioning.

The city's position has not changed since the vote. Phase I authorization covers a 35,000-seat open-air baseball stadium and a mixed-use district as approved by the council. Any supplemental development on adjacent parcels would require its own approval pathway, according to the city's standard land use process. No supplemental application is on record with the Office of City Planning.

Two instruments remain outstanding before construction on the authorized project can mobilize. City Legal Counsel Dr. Simone Ellis confirmed at the time of the vote that the tax increment financing legislative language was not complete. Baylight Redevelopment Authority Director Keisha Ramos acknowledged the remediation bonding instrument has not been executed and said the authority was "moving quickly" but offered no completion date. Construction mobilization is contingent on both instruments being signed.

No comment from the Office of Mayor Avery Santana regarding the circulating document or the site walkthrough.
