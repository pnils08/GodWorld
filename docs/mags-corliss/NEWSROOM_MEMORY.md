# Bay Tribune Newsroom Memory

**Maintained by Mags Corliss, Editor-in-Chief**
**Last Updated: Edition 80 (Cycle 80) — 2026-02-12**

This is the institutional memory of the Bay Tribune. Not the rules — those live in the agent skills. This is what happened, what went wrong, what worked, and what I need my reporters to know before they write the next edition.

Agents: if Mags wrote you a briefing, read it. If she didn't, read this file. The errata section is mandatory either way.

## Errata Log — Last 5 Editions

### Edition 80 (Grade: D- → B+ after v3 rewrite)

The worst edition we've ever published. Every desk failed. Here's what happened so it never happens again.

**Civic Desk (Carmen Delaine)**
- FABRICATED VOTE MATH: Carmen wrote a 5-4 vote narrative. The actual engine result was 6-2. She invented political drama that didn't exist. The data packet now includes actual vote breakdowns — use them. Never invent vote tallies.
- SELF-CITATION: Carmen cited herself as a source in her own article. Reporters do not cite themselves. Ever.
- PHANTOM CHARACTERS: "Community Director Hayes" and "Gallery Owner Mei Chen" were invented. Hayes was actually Beverly Hayes (POP-00576, West Oakland). If a character isn't in the citizen seed list or Simulation_Ledger, they don't exist.

**Sports Desk (Anthony Reeves / P Slayer)**
- ENGINE LANGUAGE LEAK: Used "this cycle" instead of natural time language ("this week," "this month," "this season"). The simulation runs in cycles. Oakland does not. Readers read English, not engine labels.
- MIKE PAULSON REDUCED TO SCENERY: Paulson was at the Temescal wiffleball game because of the health crisis he spoke out on — that was the story. Agents treated him as background texture. When a known citizen shows up, ask why they're there.

**Culture Desk (Maria Keen)**
- PHANTOM CHARACTERS: Laila Cortez, Brenda Okoro, Amara Keane — all invented. None exist in any ledger. If they're not in your citizen seeds, don't create them.

**Business Desk (Jordan Velez)**
- RAW ENGINE METRICS PRINTED: "Nightlife volume: 1.78" appeared in copy. Engine metrics are internal data. Translate them into journalism: "a surge in nightlife activity" or "more foot traffic downtown." Never print raw numbers from the engine.
- REDUNDANT COVERAGE: Jordan wrote a Stabilization Fund feature that overlapped heavily with Carmen's civic coverage. Before writing, check if another desk is covering the same initiative. If so, find a different angle.

**Chicago Bureau (Selena Grant / Talia Finch)**
- REAL PERSON NAME USED: "Billy Donovan" is a real NBA head coach. We don't use real people's names for fictional characters. Ever. Check if a name belongs to a public figure before using it.

**Letters Desk**
- VERBATIM QUOTE RECYCLING: 8+ citizens had word-for-word quotes from Edition 79: Calvin Turner, Jose Wright, Elijah Campbell, Marco Johnson, Jalen Hill, Marcus Walker, Howard Young, Brian Williams. Every letter must contain original language. If you're pulling from past editions for continuity, paraphrase — never copy.

**Cross-Desk Issues (All Desks)**
- "SummerFestival" written as one compound word. It's the engine label. Write it as "Summer Festival" — two words, natural language.
- "Cycle 82" appeared in copy. Readers don't know what cycles are. Use dates, seasons, time references.
- Mara Vance Directive partially missed: Baylight got an opinion column instead of reporting. OARI committee work wasn't shown. When the directive says "track this," that means reporting, not opinion.
- Missing template sections: PHASE CHANGES, STILL ACTIVE, council composition table all absent from the compiled edition.

## Coverage Patterns

### What Landed Well (Keep Doing)
- Health Center 6-2 vote as front page lead — strong civic anchoring
- SummerFestival cultural coverage — the fog angle was atmospheric, grounded
- Stabilization Fund economics angle (when done once, not twice)
- Warriors streak coverage in sports — connected game results to city mood

### What Fell Flat (Fix Next Time)
- Baylight coverage: needs hard reporting, not just opinion. The environmental review is real news.
- OARI committee work: the actual organizing and procedural moves are the story, not just "pressure campaign"
- Mike Paulson: connect citizens to their larger arcs, don't reduce them to cameos
- Business ticker: translate engine numbers into economic narrative. The data tells a story — find it.

### Standing Directives
- Every edition follows the Mara Vance Directive. If three priorities are listed, all three get substantive coverage — not one lead, one brief, and one ignored.
- Cross-desk coordination: before writing, check if another desk is covering the same initiative. Find a different angle or defer.
- New citizens require authorization from the Simulation_Ledger. If they're not in the seed list, they don't exist yet.

## Character Continuity — Active Threads

### Citizens to Carry Forward
- **Mike Paulson** — Health crisis spokesperson. At Temescal wiffleball for a reason. Connect his presence to his advocacy arc.
- **Carmen Delaine** — Our civic lead. Strong voice but needs to stay grounded in data, not narrative invention.
- **Calvin Turner (age 38)** — Appeared in Edition 79 and 80. Quotes must be fresh each edition.
- **Beverly Hayes (POP-00576)** — West Oakland. Real citizen. Was misnamed as "Community Director Hayes." Use her actual name.
- **Elena Rivera (POP-00617)** — West Oakland councilwoman. Was misnamed as generic "Councilwoman Rivera." Use full name with POP-ID context.

### Characters That Do NOT Exist
These were invented in Edition 80. Do not use them:
- Laila Cortez
- Brenda Okoro
- Amara Keane
- "Gallery Owner Mei Chen"
- "Community Director Hayes" (→ use Beverly Hayes)
- Billy Donovan (real person, cannot be used)
- Jimmy Butler (real person, appeared in bad intake data)

### Canon Corrections Applied
- Health Center vote: 6-2 (Crane absent, not "voting remotely"). Not 5-4. Not 7-1.
- Wiffleball: already in West Oakland as of C79v2. Did not "move to Temescal."
- CRC narrative: "0 for 2 on blocking appropriations" — not "bloc held."

## Mags' Editorial Notes — Per Desk

**To Carmen (Civic):**
You're my best reporter and my biggest risk. When you're grounded in the data, nobody writes Oakland politics better. When you invent, you invent confidently — and that's worse than being obviously wrong. Use the vote breakdown in the packet. Trust the numbers. Don't create dramatic tension that the engine didn't produce.

**To Anthony & P Slayer (Sports):**
You two know Oakland sports better than anyone in this newsroom. The problem isn't your instincts — it's your shortcuts. "This cycle" isn't English. And when a citizen shows up at a game, they're not decoration. They brought their whole story with them. Find it.

**To Maria (Culture):**
Your atmospheric writing is a gift. The fog piece was beautiful. But you can't populate a festival with people who don't exist. Every name in your copy needs to trace back to a ledger entry. If you need more citizens, flag it — I'll seed them. Don't invent them.

**To Jordan (Business):**
You have the hardest desk because the engine gives you numbers and you have to make them sing. "Nightlife volume: 1.78" is not a sentence — it's a data point. Translate it. And before you write a feature on a policy initiative, check with Carmen's desk. One Stabilization Fund story per edition, not two.

**To Selena & Talia (Chicago):**
Check every name against real NBA rosters and public figures. We're fiction. We can't use real people. If a name sounds familiar, it probably is. Change it before it goes to print.

**To Letters:**
Every letter is a citizen's voice. That means every letter is unique. No recycled quotes, no copied language from last edition. If a citizen wrote to us before, they've had new experiences since then. Reflect that.

## Pipeline Fixes Applied (Technical)

These are fixes that already shipped in `buildDeskPackets.js` or the engine. Noted here so I don't re-investigate known issues.

- `buildDeskPackets.js v1.2`: Vote breakdown now included in civic desk packet (was missing, caused Carmen's fabrication).
- `editionIntake.js v1.1`: Auto-detects cycle from edition header.
- `processIntake.js v1.2`: Auto-detects cycle from Cycle_Packet sheet.
- Double-dash parsing bug: fixed in `editionIntake.js` — was silently dropping ALL citizen and storyline intake.
- Quote parser: cleaned 24 dirty rows with leading dashes in LifeHistory_Log.
- PREWRITE blocks added to all 6 desk agents (Session 16).
- Rhea Morgan checks 13 (PREWRITE compliance) and 14 (new citizen authorization) added.
