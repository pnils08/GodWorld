Part II — Benji Dillon and the Shadow of the Big Three

Oakland has seen great pitchers before. The early-2000s A’s lived on the shoulders of three of them: Barry Zito, Tim Hudson, and Mark Mulder. They were the foundation of a franchise that had to out-think richer teams, out-develop stronger ones, and win in an era where every mistake was amplified.

But when you line those names next to Benji Dillon, something unusual happens. The comparison doesn’t shrink Dillon — it shrinks the old standard.

The Big Three were remarkable because they arrived together. Hudson was the edge, Mulder was the classic build, Zito was the curveball that bent probability. They carried the expectations of a franchise that had no margin for error. But none of them ever put together the kind of sustained dominance that Dillon managed over twenty seasons.

Dillon threw 200 wins in a tighter pitching environment than any of the Big Three ever faced. His 3.58 career ERA came in an era defined by rising launch angles, deeper bullpens, and hitters who trained year-round to lift anything in the zone. The strikeout totals alone separate him from the early-2000s staff. More than three thousand strikeouts. More than 2700 innings. Five Cy Young Awards — a number that no pitcher from the Big Three era ever approached.

Zito was brilliant in flashes — 2002 being his high-water mark. Hudson carried grit and consistency. Mulder, before injuries, was power with touch. But Dillon has a season none of them ever had: 2037. Eighteen wins. Four losses. A 2.30 earned run average. Two hundred thirty-six strikeouts. Fourteen home runs allowed in a full season. Those are numbers that silence comparisons, not invite them.

It’s not disrespect to the Big Three. Their success gave Oakland a blueprint: rely on development, trust your system, build pitchers instead of buying them. But Dillon wasn’t the evolution of that blueprint. He was the proof that it could produce something the rest of the league couldn’t replicate.

What separates him most is longevity. The Big Three gave Oakland five or six good seasons. Dillon gave them two decades. Some years he built the dynasty. Some years he saved it. Some years he carried it when the offense went quiet or the bullpen collapsed. He never needed perfect conditions. He just needed the ball.

History will always remember Zito, Hudson, and Mulder in the collective. That was their identity — the trio. Dillon stands alone because pitchers like him always do. He didn’t arrive with partners. He didn’t share the load. He didn’t fit into an era. He defined one.
