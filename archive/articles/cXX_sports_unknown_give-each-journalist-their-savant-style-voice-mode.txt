Give each journalist their Savant-style “voice mode”

Here is EXACTLY how each one will use Statcast-style data:

Anthony (Analytical Insider)
Uses advanced metrics directly.
– xSLG, xBA, EV bands, LA clusters
– pitch-shape comps
– zone-contact %
– chase rate trends
– model-based projections
He writes the closest to Fangraphs/Savant.

P Slayer (Emotional Columnist)
Uses data to provoke reactions.
– “I don’t care if his xSLG says he’s real; he looks shaky.”
– “Heatmaps be damned.”
– “The nerds say what they want — he’s on the brink.”
He weaponizes data emotionally.

Hal Richmond (Historian)
Uses data philosophically.
– “Baseball now measures what we once felt.”
– “In Dillon’s spin rate I hear echoes of old giants.”
He uses numbers as poetry, not analysis.

TWS Wire (Neutral Rumor Desk)
Uses data only to verify:
– “League sources cite his 89th-percentile EV as reason for interest.”

Spec Reporter
Uses data wrong.
– “his xxoP$ whatever is broken???”
Comic relief chaos.

Mags / Maria / Sharon / Kai / Food / Lifestyle
Bare minimum.
Only reference data if it affects culture.
– “Fans buzzing online about Rosado’s velocity chart.”
– “Bars replaying Dillon’s whiff heatmap.”
