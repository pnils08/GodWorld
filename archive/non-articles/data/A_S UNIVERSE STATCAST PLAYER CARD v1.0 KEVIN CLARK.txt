HITTING PROFILE

Hard-Hit%:
Not elite, but rising — power projection starting to form.

Barrel%:
Low right now (expected at age 20), but trending positively.

Avg Exit Velocity:
Below-average for corner infielders, but the bat path is clean and projectable.

Max Exit Velocity:
Shows flashes — real strength behind contact when he catches the inner half.

Launch Angle:
Moderate → line drive oriented.
Not a power bat yet, but LA suggests doubles-first profile.

Sweet-Spot%:
Above-average — smooth, repeatable swing.

Whiff%:
Low for his age — impressive bat control.

Chase%:
Disciplined — better than typical A-ball/AA hitters.

xBA:
Strong, stands out in the org.

xSLG:
Currently modest, but has room for serious growth as raw power develops.

Summary:
Clark is a contact + discipline hitter with real projection — his approach is YEARS ahead of typical 20-year-olds.

PLATE APPROACH & ZONE BEHAVIOR

Pull / Center / Oppo %: Pull-heavy (natural identity)

Hot Zones:
• Belt-high, center-in
• Low-middle

Cold Zones:
• Elevated fastballs
• Soft away (expected for young hitters)

Zone Summary:
Clark sees the ball deeper than most prospects.
His VIS 56 → CLT 82 combo makes him dangerous late in games.

⸻

TRAIT BREAKDOWN (TrueSource attributes)
Defense:
• FLD 73 (already MLB-adjacent)
• REAC 56 (needs refinement)
• ARM 74 (strong)

Base Running:
• SPD 72 (sneaky fast)
• STEAL 80 (elite instincts)
• BR AGG 70 (aggressive, smart)

Slash-line Projection (Future MLB Avg):
.270–.288 AVG
.340–.360 OBP
.420–.450 SLG

⸻

POSITIONS / DEFENSE

Primary: 3B
Secondary: 2B, RF

Third Base:
• Clean footwork
• Plus arm for size
• Above-average glove → potential long-term average MLB 3B

Second Base:
• Strong lateral quickness
• Developing pivots

Right Field (Utility Future):
• Good athlete
• Speed plays better in OF than INF at times

Summary:
He could become the perfect Swiss-army-knife position player.

⸻

RUNNING / ATHLETICISM

Sprint Speed: 72
Steal Rating: 80
BR Aggressiveness: 70

He plays faster than his size —
think “short, dense, explosive.”

⸻

DEVELOPMENT ARCH

Clark is only 20 and already in AAA — that alone signals elite internal grades.

Growth indicators:
• +7 CON R
• +7 VISION
• +7 CLUTCH
• +6 FLD

This is what “future organizational pillar” development looks like.

ETA: Late 2041 – early 2042
Not Rule 5 eligible → no roster risk yet.

⸻

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Clark’s discipline is outrageous for his age — borderline “veteran plate approach.”
• His glove will carry him into MLB even before his bat fully matures.
• Contact floor is high → bust probability very low.
• Power is the question. If it comes, he becomes a 3–4 WAR player.
• Potential future comp: David Fletcher with more pop OR Justin Turner-lite depending on LA development.

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“He’s built like someone who should NOT hit moonshots — but every once in a while he WRECKS one.
Guys like this always sneak up on a league.
Give him two years and he’s the fan favorite nobody saw coming.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Clark is the kind of player who outgrows expectations by simply doing everything well.
Every dynasty has one — a quiet cornerstone who wasn’t supposed to be the story but becomes one anyway.”
