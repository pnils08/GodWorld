SCOUTING CARD: LOW-LAUNCH / HIGH-EXIT VELOCITY BREAKOUT CANDIDATE

Player Type: Power-capable hitter with suppressed game production due to low average launch angle.
Organizational Grade: High-priority mechanical optimization candidate.

⸻

Physical / Tool Summary
	•	Hit Tool: 50 present / 60 future
Contact quality is elite when squared; swing path currently produces too many low-trajectory batted balls. Timing intact. Ball stays on bat deep.
	•	Power: 65 present / 70 future
Exit velocity readings indicate above-league power. Underlying contact authority suggests home-run totals should be significantly higher with trajectory improvement.
	•	Approach: 55
Tracks velocity well. Shows selective aggression but sometimes over-commits to pitches low in the zone, reinforcing steep bat path.
	•	Run: 45
Functional athlete; speed plays only on doubles into gaps.
	•	Field: 50
Steady defender; no major liabilities. Profiles best when bat carries value.
	•	Arm: 50–60 depending on position
Accurate throws. No red flags.

Batted Ball Profile (Pre-Adjustment)
	•	Max Exit Velocity: Ninety-fifth percentile
	•	Average Exit Velocity: Above league average
	•	Hard-Hit Rate: High (forty-plus percent)
	•	Average Launch Angle: Four degrees (low)
	•	Ground-Ball Rate: Fifty-five to sixty percent
	•	Barrel Rate: Below expected for EV; diagnostic for trajectory inefficiency

Summary:
The foundational power is present. The bat is simply oriented too flat, creating a surplus of hard grounders and low line drives. Statcast models indicate significantly higher production potential if launch angle stabilizes between ten and sixteen degrees.

Developmental Focus

Primary Adjustment:
Introduce moderate bat-path lift through:
	•	Early-glove-side slot alignment
	•	Shortened rear-hip dip
	•	Emphasis on contacting ball slightly farther out front
	•	High-velocity machine work up in zone

Secondary Work:
	•	Tighten launch-angle variance
	•	Reduce low-zone chase
	•	Improve consistency against elevated four-seam fastballs

Projected improvement window: 4–8 weeks with consistent reps.

⸻

Breakout Projection

With successful adjustment:
	•	Home Runs: +8 to +14 increase over full season
	•	Barrel Rate: Expected 30–45% jump
	•	OPS: +.060 to +.120 rise
	•	Heatmap Shift: Hard contact migrates from shallow outfield to alleys and pull-side wall

Player becomes legitimate middle-of-order threat or high-value trade asset.

⸻

Risk Factors
	•	Entrenched muscle memory—slow adoption curve possible
	•	Over-correction could induce uppercut and increased whiff rate
	•	Lower-zone pitch preference may require retraining

Organizational Note

“If he adds five to eight degrees of lift without sacrificing EV, he jumps a full tier as a hitter. Everything is already in the bat—the path just needs altitude.”
