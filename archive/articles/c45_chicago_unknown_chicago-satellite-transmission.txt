## SELENA GRANT | Bulls Beat
“The Three Who Changed Everything”

Before we talk about what Hank Trepagnier did on opening night, we need to talk about where he came from.

El Salvador.

Not a basketball country. Not a pipeline. Not a place where scouts go looking for 6’11” centers with 73 three-point ratings and the athleticism to run the floor like a guard. Trepagnier grew up in San Salvador playing fútbol until he was fifteen, when a growth spurt changed everything. By seventeen he was playing for a club team in Mexico City. By nineteen he was in the G League on a tryout contract nobody expected to convert.

Paulson found him in summer league footage. That’s the story everyone keeps telling. But I talked to someone in the Bulls front office who was in the room when Paulson first pulled up the tape.

“He watched one possession. Trepagnier caught a pass at the elbow, pump-faked a closeout, took one dribble, and dunked on two guys. Mike just said, ‘Get him.’ That was it. ‘Get him.’”

The scouting report said he couldn’t shoot. The scouting report was wrong — or Trepagnier figured it out in the last eighteen months. His three-point stroke is unconventional but it goes in. His free throw is clean. And his standing dunk rating is reportedly the highest on the roster.

But here’s the thing about Trepagnier: his personality file says “Wildcard.” That’s a real designation. It means the organization doesn’t know what they’re getting night to night. It means the ceiling is high and the floor is unpredictable.

Opening night was the ceiling. 10-for-10. 26 points. The United Center chanting a name nobody knew six months ago.

The question is what happens next.

## MARCELLO REYES | League Analysis
“Paulson’s Draft Philosophy: Why Buy When You Can Find?”

The Bulls used the 12th pick in the 2025 draft on Noa Essengue. French forward, 6’8”, eighteen years old, the youngest player on the roster. By traditional measures, he’s the cornerstone — the legitimate first-round prospect around whom you build.

But look at the roster Paulson actually assembled.

Hank Trepagnier: undrafted. 82 overall. Starting center.

Adash Stanley: undrafted. 75 overall with A-potential. Backup point guard who might not be a backup for long.

The 12th pick? Essengue is 72 overall with C-potential. He’s raw. He’s thin at 194 pounds. His offensive consistency rating is reportedly in the low 50s — meaning some nights he’ll look like a future All-Star and other nights he’ll disappear.

This isn’t an accident. Paulson’s philosophy in Oakland was always about finding value where others weren’t looking. He traded for Travis Coles when Washington didn’t realize what they had. He signed Eric Tavares before the market understood his ceiling. He built championship rosters by identifying players whose ratings didn’t match their potential.

Now he’s doing it in basketball.

Stanley is nineteen years old, from Poland, and his three-point rating is reportedly 86. That’s elite. That’s starter-level shooting from a teenager making the minimum. His hustle rating is maxed — 99. The kid doesn’t stop moving.

Essengue has the pedigree. He has the draft position. But if I’m betting on who matters most to this roster in three years, I’m not sure it’s the first-round pick.

Paulson doesn’t build through the draft. He builds through vision.

## TALIA FINCH | Ground Report
“Three Kids, Three Countries, One City”

I spent the day after opening night tracking down anyone who knew anything about the Bulls’ three rookies.

Trepagnier has an aunt in Pilsen. She watched the game at a sports bar on 18th Street with about forty people, most of whom had never heard of her nephew until tip-off. By the fourth quarter they were buying her drinks. “He called me after,” she told me. “He was calm. Like it was normal. That’s Hank. Nothing is ever a big deal to him.”

The “Wildcard” designation makes more sense now. It’s not instability — it’s detachment. Trepagnier plays like he’s got nothing to prove because, to him, he doesn’t. He’s already exceeded every expectation anyone ever had for a kid from San Salvador who didn’t pick up a basketball until high school.

Stanley is harder to track. Polish, nineteen, no local connections I could find. But I talked to a trainer at the practice facility who works with the young guys. “Adash is the first one in every morning. Every morning. Doesn’t say much. Just works. His shooting form is weird but the ball goes in and he doesn’t care what anyone thinks about the mechanics.”

The trainer said Stanley’s English is limited but his basketball IQ is high. “He sees the game differently. Like he’s solving a puzzle instead of playing a sport.”

Essengue I couldn’t get much on. He’s eighteen, he’s French, he’s quiet, and the organization is protecting him. One source said he’s “still adjusting to the speed.” Another said he’s “more talented than people realize but needs to put on thirty pounds.”

Three kids. Three countries. El Salvador, Poland, France.

Paulson looked at the entire world and said: these three.
