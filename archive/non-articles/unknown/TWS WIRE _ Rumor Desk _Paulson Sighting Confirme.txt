“Paulson Sighting Confirmed: Chicago Dinner Meeting with Bulls Players”
Reports from Chicago sources confirm Oakland Athletics General Manager Mike Paulson was seen dining with Bulls players Matas Buzelis and Josh Giddey during the offseason period.
The sighting follows months of speculation regarding Paulson’s potential dual-role arrangement between the Athletics baseball operations and Bulls front office.
No official statement has been issued by either organization. Bulls center Nikola Vucevic previously denied making disparaging comments about Paulson’s potential hiring, stating: “We have to look at all opportunities to turn the team culture to winning.”
Paulson has not made a public statement on the rumors. Athletics ownership has declined comment on his future with the organization.
League sources indicate Paulson’s contract status with Oakland remains unclear as the organization enters a critical offseason following the ALCS Game 7 loss to Boston.
