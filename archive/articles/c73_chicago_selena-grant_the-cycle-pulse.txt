BULLS WIN NBA CUP — TREPAGNIER DOMINATES IN 38-POINT BLOWOUT

Chicago completes improbable run with franchise's first title since Jordan era

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

LAS VEGAS — The Bulls are champions again.

Chicago demolished the Minnesota Timberwolves 102-64 in the NBA Cup Finals, the most lopsided championship game in tournament history. Hank Trepagnier, the 21-year-old center from El Salvador who wasn't supposed to be here, finished with 24 points, 18 rebounds, 3 assists, and 2 steals. He was named MVP before he'd even finished his postgame water bottle.

The Timberwolves never found their footing. Anthony Edwards, the player everyone assumed would dominate this stage, managed just 16 points on inefficient shooting. Julius Randle added 21, but it was garbage time arithmetic. The game was over by halftime.

"This is what we built," Mike Paulson said in the tunnel afterward, championship cap already on his head. "Not a fluke. A foundation."

Josh Giddey orchestrated from the opening tip: 17 points, 15 assists, 5 rebounds. Matas Buzelis added 20. Walker Kessler, coming off the bench, contributed 10 points and 10 rebounds in limited minutes — a reminder that the trade rumors swirling around him haven't affected his preparation.

The United Center watch party erupted. Chicago hadn't celebrated a basketball championship since 1998. An entire generation had grown up without this feeling.

Paulson built this roster in four months. He gutted the old core — Vucevic, Derozan, Coby White — and rebuilt around youth and potential. The draft picks he accumulated sit in a war chest. The young core he assembled just proved they can win.

The question now shifts: What comes next?

BAYLIGHT DISTRICT BREAKTHROUGH: A'S OWNERSHIP, CITY REACH PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT

Paulson backs Oakland return as stadium plan heads to planning committee

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

The A's are coming home.

Mayor Avery Santana and A's ownership announced a preliminary agreement on the Baylight District project, the mixed-use waterfront development that would bring professional baseball back to Oakland permanently after last season's exile in Phoenix.

The deal requires no public funding. Ownership is seeking tax exemptions rather than direct investment — a structure that sidesteps the political landmines that have torpedoed stadium negotiations in cities across the country.

"Oakland is the A's home," Santana said at a press conference Monday. "This framework respects taxpayers while creating the conditions for long-term investment in our city."

The plan now advances to the City Planning Committee for a formal vote. Approval there would trigger environmental review and public comment periods, with construction potentially beginning by Year 4.

Mike Paulson, speaking from Las Vegas hours after the Bulls' championship victory, threw his full support behind the Oakland return.

"I've always believed this franchise belongs in Oakland," Paulson said. "The Baylight District represents everything we've been working toward — a permanent home, community integration, long-term stability. I'm committed to seeing this through."

It was a notable statement from an executive who has faced months of questions about his divided attention. The championship trophy in one hand, the stadium promise in the other — Paulson is betting he can hold both.

Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei, the city's lead stadium negotiator, remains hospitalized and was not present for the announcement. Chief of Staff Laila Cortez handled interim discussions. Osei's condition has not been updated since Cycle 72.

The Baylight Redevelopment Board will convene in Cycle 74 to review preliminary plans.

MEMORIAL DAY PARADE DRAWS THOUSANDS TO LAKE MERRITT

Oakland honors fallen with community gathering despite windy conditions

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

The flags snapped in the wind along Lakeshore Avenue, but nobody left.

Thousands gathered at Lake Merritt Monday for the annual Memorial Day parade and community celebration, honoring fallen service members with a procession that wound from the amphitheater to the Veterans Memorial Building on Grand Avenue.

The weather didn't cooperate — gusts reached 20 mph by midday, toppling vendor tents and sending napkins spiraling across the grass. But the crowd stayed. Families spread blankets. Veterans in dress uniforms accepted handshakes from strangers. Children waved small flags their parents had picked up at the dollar store.

"My grandfather served in Korea," said Rosa Ochoa, a library worker from Laurel who's been attending the parade since Cycle 34. "I come every year. The wind doesn't matter."

The Community Joy Parade — the informal name for the post-ceremony celebration — drew participants from every neighborhood. BBQ smoke drifted from Patriot BBQ's pop-up station in West Oakland. Uptown Eats served coffee to the early crowd. By afternoon, the Civic Watch Patio was standing room only.

Sentiment across the city hit +0.65, the highest reading since the simulation began tracking. Whatever tensions Oakland carries — the health crisis in Temescal, the outflow from West Oakland, the civic officials still hospitalized — today the city exhaled.

"Summer starts now," one parade-goer said, packing up as the wind finally calmed toward evening. "Everything else can wait until tomorrow."

TEMESCAL HEALTH ARC CONTINUES — COMMUNITY BONDS STRENGTHEN

Wave 4 persists as neighbors organize mutual support networks

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Bay Tribune Health Desk

The illness rate in Temescal hasn't dropped. But something else is happening.

Community engagement in the neighborhood has surged even as the health crisis enters its fifth week. Neighbors are checking on neighbors. Meal trains have formed. A mutual aid network operating out of the Temescal Shelter-Hub has expanded its reach to adjacent blocks.

"We stopped waiting for answers," said Ivy Cruz, a Temescal resident who arrived during Cycle 71. "If the city can't tell us what's happening, at least we can take care of each other."

The arc strength remains elevated. Clinics continue monitoring. No symptom profile has been released. The connection to previous waves — if any exists — remains unconfirmed.

But the community response suggests something the data can't capture: resilience building in real time. When the official systems stall, the neighborhood systems activate.

I'll continue tracking the medical indicators. But the human story here is the neighbors who decided not to wait.

WEST OAKLAND OUTFLOW ACCELERATES — MIGRATION DRIFT HITS -45

Departures spike as Memorial Day weekend prompts reflection

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Metro

The moving trucks were out again on 7th Street.

Migration drift hit -45 this cycle — the worst reading in recent memory. For every new arrival in Oakland, 45 more packed their things and left. West Oakland remains the epicenter, storefronts dark, "For Lease" signs multiplying like a rash that won't heal.

The holiday weekend seemed to accelerate the decision for some families. Memorial Day barbecues became farewell parties. Relatives visiting from out of town saw the empty buildings and asked the obvious question.

"My sister came from Phoenix," one departing resident said, loading boxes into a U-Haul. "She asked why I was still here. I didn't have a good answer."

The economy remains stable. Employment holds at 91%. The A's stadium deal announced this week could theoretically reverse the trend — investment brings jobs, jobs bring people, people bring life.

But that's future tense. The moving trucks are present tense. And they're not slowing down.

DOWNTOWN SHOCK FLAG PERSISTS — FRUITVALE EMERGENCY BRIEFING SCHEDULED

Civic systems show minor variance as unexplained disruption continues

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

Whatever's happening downtown hasn't stopped.

The shock flag that triggered in Cycle 69 remains active. Civic systems show "minor variance" — the same designation from last cycle. City officials have not explained what caused the initial disruption or why it persists.

A Fruitvale Emergency Town Briefing has been scheduled for Cycle 74, though the agenda has not been released. Community members have speculated the briefing connects to the health crisis in neighboring Temescal, but city communications staff declined to confirm.

"We'll have more information to share at the appropriate time," said Theo Park, the Mayor's Communications Director.

The non-answer satisfied no one. But with Memorial Day festivities dominating the cycle, the questions were muted — for now.

THE CASE FOR DANNY HORN: BEST PLAYER IN BASEBALL?

A's center fielder makes his argument — and the numbers back him up

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Danny Horn thinks he's the best player in baseball.

He said so himself, unprompted, during a spring training interview that raised eyebrows across the industry. But before you dismiss it as ego, consider what he did in 2040:

.280 average. 32 home runs. 98 RBIs. 35 stolen bases. .524 slugging. .879 OPS. 8.0 WAR.

That's not a good season. That's a historically excellent one. The 30-30 club is exclusive enough — Horn went 32-35. Only four players in the last decade have posted an 8.0 WAR while playing center field and stealing 30+ bases.

"I play both sides of the ball at an elite level," Horn said. "I hit for average, I hit for power, I steal bases, I play gold-glove defense. Name someone doing all four at this level. I'll wait."

The waiting is the point. Horn, now 29, emerged from an unremarkable early career to become a two-time All-Star and Silver Slugger winner. His 2039 season — .322, 43 homers, 28 steals — announced his arrival among the game's elite. His 2040 proved it wasn't a fluke.

Historical comparisons get tricky. Willie Mays averaged 8.2 WAR across his peak seasons while playing center and stealing 20+ bases annually. Mike Trout's best years reached similar heights. But Horn's combination of power and speed, at his position, puts him in rarefied air.

Career totals: .245 average, 111 homers, 127 stolen bases through seven seasons. The early years — including that brutal .166 campaign in 2033 — drag down the cumulative numbers. But trajectory matters. Horn's last two seasons project a player entering his prime.

"People look at career stats and think they know you," Horn said. "They don't know who I am now."

The A's extended him through 2044 at $37.8 million per year. At the time, some questioned whether a switch-hitter with a .245 career average deserved that commitment.

Nobody's questioning it anymore.

BENJI DILLON ON COVER OF SCIENCE MONTHLY — AGAIN

The "Golden Arm" earns recognition for water filtration work, not baseball

By Simon Leary | Bay Tribune — The Long View

The second time is different.

Benji Dillon first appeared on the cover of Science Monthly in 2031, a profile examining how advanced biomechanics had extended his pitching career. It was a sports story dressed in scientific clothing — impressive, but ultimately about baseball.

This time, the 38-year-old left-hander graces the cover for work that has nothing to do with his 98-mph fastball.

The Dillon Foundation's water filtration initiative has now provided clean drinking water to an estimated 400,000 people across sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. The technology — developed in partnership with engineers at Stanford — uses a low-cost ceramic membrane system that can be manufactured locally and maintained without specialized training.

"When I'm done playing, this is what I want to be remembered for," Dillon told Science Monthly. "The strikeouts are nice. The championships matter. But clean water? That saves lives. That's legacy."

Dillon re-signed with Oakland this offseason for one year at $13 million. The "farewell tour" narrative writes itself — five Cy Young awards, Rookie of the Year, 200 career wins, 3,219 strikeouts. He'll slot into the back of the rotation behind Rivas, Ramos, Coles, and Ellis, a luxury most teams can only dream about.

But for one news cycle, the baseball was secondary. The cover shows Dillon in a dusty village, not a dugout, crouching next to a child drinking from a filtration tap.

"The arm is borrowed time," Dillon said. "The water is permanent."

SEYMOUR ADDRESSES STRENGTH COACH DISMISSAL

First-year manager provides clarity on practice facility incident

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Deacon Seymour is done dodging the question.

The first-year A's manager addressed the practice facility incident directly during a spring training media session, confirming details that had circulated as rumor for weeks.

"There was a violation of team policy involving a member of our strength and conditioning staff," Seymour said. "That individual is no longer with the organization. I'm not going to get into specifics because it's a personnel matter, but I'll say this: we have standards. When those standards aren't met, we act."

The incident occurred during Cycle 44, coinciding with a small fire at the facility while Darrin Davis was rehabbing his ACL. Seymour declined to confirm any connection between the two events.

"Darrin's recovery has been on schedule throughout," Seymour said. "He'll be ready for preseason. That's all that matters."

The acknowledgment was notable for Seymour, who has carefully managed his public presence during a challenging first spring. The lineup leak that plagued his opening days has faded from conversation. The clubhouse has settled into routines.

"I'm not here to hide from questions," Seymour said. "I'm here to build something. That starts with trust — with my players, with the staff, with the fans. You can't build trust by pretending things didn't happen."

The A's open preseason against San Diego. Seymour will manage his first professional game.

SPRING TRAINING PREVIEW: A'S VS. PADRES TO OPEN

Rotation depth, Davis return headline preseason storylines

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Baseball is almost here.

The A's open preseason against San Diego, the first competitive action since October's disappointing playoff exit. The storylines are stacked:

THE ROTATION: Henry Rivas, Arturo Ramos, Travis Coles, John Ellis, Benji Dillon. On paper, that's the deepest five Oakland has fielded in a decade. Rivas (91 overall) anchors. Coles, the 21-year-old acquired in November's blockbuster, has All-Star ceiling. Ellis is the rookie everyone's watching. Dillon is the farewell tour.

THE MVP RETURN: Darrin Davis takes live at-bats for the first time since tearing his ACL. The 2039 MVP's recovery has been described as "on schedule," but nobody knows what that means until he faces actual pitching.

THE KEANE GOODBYE: Vinnie Keane's final season begins. The 38-year-old third baseman — six championships, 3,000+ hits, Oakland legend — will play every game like it's his last. Because it might be.

THE MANAGER: Deacon Seymour has never managed a professional game. His first one is days away.

Mike Paulson will attend, according to team sources — his first appearance in Mesa after spending the entire spring in Chicago. The championship trophy presumably stays in Illinois.

CHICAGO REPORT

BULLS ROSTER GIVES BACK — HOLIDAY YOUTH PROGRAM DRAWS HUNDREDS

Championship team volunteers with Chicago youth literacy initiative

By Talia Finch | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The trophy was still warm when they showed up to read.

Josh Giddey, Hank Trepagnier, Matas Buzelis, Adash Stanley, Isaac Okoro, and Kevin Huerter — still wearing their championship gear — volunteered Monday afternoon at the Chicago Youth Literacy Project's Memorial Day program. Hundreds of children from South Side neighborhoods cycled through the United Center's community room, sitting cross-legged while professional basketball players stumbled through picture books.

"I'm not great at the voices," Giddey admitted, attempting a pirate accent that sounded vaguely Australian. "But the kids didn't seem to mind."

The Youth Literacy Project, founded in 2019, provides books and reading support to underserved schools across Chicago. The Bulls' involvement began during training camp; the championship timing was coincidental — and perfect.

"These kids will remember this forever," said program director Maria Santos. "Champions reading them stories. That's not normal."

Trepagnier, the MVP, spent extra time with a group of third-graders who peppered him with questions about El Salvador, basketball, and whether he could dunk on their gym teacher.

"Probably," Trepagnier said. "But I'd be nice about it."

KESSLER TRADE RUMORS SWIRL — DO ANY MAKE SENSE?

Front office accumulates offers but paths to improvement are unclear

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — Walker Kessler is available. The question is whether anyone can meet the price — and whether the return actually helps.

The Bulls center, relegated to bench duty behind Hank Trepagnier's emergence, has drawn interest from multiple teams. League sources indicate three active discussions:

KNICKS PACKAGE: Quentin Grimes and Trendon Watford. Grimes, 24, averaged 11.3 points last season with solid three-point shooting. Watford provides depth but isn't a rotation piece. Analysis: Marginal upgrade at wing, but neither player moves the needle for a championship roster.

HORNETS PACKAGE: Miles Bridges and a 2028 first-round pick (lottery protected). Bridges has the talent — 21 points per game, athletic wing play — but the off-court history is complicated. The pick adds future value. Analysis: Highest upside, highest risk. Does Paulson want that headache?

KINGS PACKAGE: Malik Monk and a 2026 first-round pick (Portland, lottery protected). Monk is a microwave scorer off the bench — 15+ points per game, but inconsistent defense. The pick is more valuable than the Hornets' offering. Analysis: Best draft asset, least impactful player.

None of these packages clearly improve Chicago. Kessler just contributed 10 points and 10 rebounds in the championship game. He's an elite defensive center on a reasonable contract. Trading him for marginal upgrades feels like change for the sake of change.

The bigger question: Is Paulson positioning for a blockbuster? The Bulls have accumulated enough draft capital to pursue a superstar. The Ja Morant speculation from Cycle 72 hasn't died. If Memphis struggles, that conversation could get serious.

For now, Kessler remains a Bull. But his phone is on.

OWNERSHIP SHAKE-UP: JORDAN, TECH BILLIONAIRE EYE BULLS STAKE

Reinsdorf sale talks advance as franchise value soars post-championship

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The Bulls may have new owners by next season.

Jerry Reinsdorf, the 89-year-old chairman who has controlled the franchise since 1985, is in advanced discussions to sell the team. Multiple sources confirm that a minority ownership group led by Michael Jordan is among the interested parties.

Jordan, who delivered six championships to Chicago as a player, would return to the franchise in an executive capacity. It would be his second ownership venture after selling his majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets in 2023.

But the more intriguing name in the group is Marcus Webb — the 43-year-old Chicago-born founder of Meridian Dynamics, a logistics technology company valued at $12 billion. Webb, who grew up on the South Side watching Jordan's dynasty, has never been publicly linked to sports ownership before.

"This isn't about ego," a source close to Webb said. "He's a Bulls fan. He has resources. And he believes in what Paulson is building."

The timing isn't coincidental. Multiple sources indicate that Paulson's acceptance of the GM position was influenced by advance knowledge that Reinsdorf was exploring a sale. The prospect of working with Jordan — or at minimum, an ownership group committed to sustained investment — made the dual-city challenge more palatable.

Reinsdorf's office declined to comment. Jordan's representatives did not respond to requests.

The franchise value, estimated at $4.1 billion before the championship, has likely increased significantly. The young core, the championship trophy, and the Paulson infrastructure all add to the appeal.

Chicago hasn't felt this optimistic about basketball since the last time Jordan wore red.

OPINION
============================================================

THE MAN WHO HAS EVERYTHING

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

Mike Paulson woke up Monday morning as a champion.

By Monday afternoon, he'd secured a stadium deal for the A's. By evening, he was being linked to a potential Michael Jordan ownership group. By the time you read this, he's probably cured a disease or discovered a new element.

I'm joking. Mostly.

Here's the thing about Paulson: he keeps proving everyone wrong. When he took the Bulls job, we said he couldn't do both. He won a championship. When he missed the Keane Gala, we said he'd lost Oakland. He just delivered a stadium framework that doesn't cost taxpayers a dime.

The man is collecting W's like they're going out of style.

But here's my question, and I'm asking it sincerely: What does he actually want?

Championships? He has six World Series rings and now an NBA Cup trophy. Money? He's got it. Legacy? He's building two franchises simultaneously while apparently solving stadium politics in his spare time.

At some point, the accumulation stops meaning anything. You can only wear one ring at a time. You can only sit in one city at a time. The trophies pile up, but you're still just one person trying to be in two places.

Oakland is excited about Baylight. Chicago is celebrating a championship. And somewhere in between, Mike Paulson is already thinking about what's next.

I hope he knows when enough is enough. I hope he knows what home means.

Because right now, he's everywhere. And everywhere is the same as nowhere.

TWO OFFICIALS, STILL MISSING

By Farrah Del Rio | Bay Tribune Opinion

Marcus Osei. Elliott Crane.

It's been two cycles since they were hospitalized. Two cycles of "serious condition" and "injured" with no updates, no explanations, no timeline.

The Mayor announced a stadium deal without her lead negotiator in the room. The City Council operated without its Business Caucus Leader. The civic machine keeps grinding, but two gears are missing.

I'm not asking for medical records. I'm asking for acknowledgment. These are public servants. The public has a right to know — not the specifics of their conditions, but whether they're recovering, whether interim leadership is permanent, whether the city is prepared for prolonged absence.

Aaron Whitfield says the systems are resilient. Laila Cortez is handling what needs handling. The official line is everything's fine.

But two empty chairs don't feel fine. They feel like something nobody wants to talk about.

Whatever happened to Marcus Osei and Elliott Crane, the silence is louder than any explanation would be.
