“Paulson Sighting Confirmed: Chicago Dinner Meeting with Bulls Players”
Reports from Chicago sources confirm Oakland Athletics General Manager Mike Paulson was seen dining with Bulls players Matas Buzelis and Josh Giddey during the offseason period.
The sighting follows months of speculation regarding Paulson’s potential dual-role arrangement between the Athletics baseball operations and Bulls front office.
No official statement has been issued by either organization. Bulls center Nikola Vucevic previously denied making disparaging comments about Paulson’s potential hiring, stating: “We have to look at all opportunities to turn the team culture to winning.”
Paulson has not made a public statement on the rumors. Athletics ownership has declined comment on his future with the organization.
League sources indicate Paulson’s contract status with Oakland remains unclear as the organization enters a critical offseason following the ALCS Game 7 loss to Boston.

“PAULSON IS GONE AND THEY’RE BURNING IT ALL DOWN: THE RECEIPTS”
OK SO EVERYONE SAID I WAS CRAZY ABOUT THE PAULSON CONSPIRACY BUT LOOK AT WHAT JUST HAPPENED:
NOVEMBER 10TH — THE COLES TRADE:
	∙	We trade away: George Whiteley (#13 prospect), Agustin Rodriguez (CAREER YEAR), Cy Newell (literally saved our season), Peter Busch
	∙	We get: Travis Coles (21yo ace, 94 overall)
THEY CALLED IT DESPERATE. THEY WERE RIGHT.
NOVEMBER 24TH — THE TAVARES SIGNING:
	∙	7 YEARS, $32.1M PER YEAR for Eric Tavares (2B)
	∙	He hit .237 last year
	∙	SEVEN. YEARS.
FEBRUARY 15TH — THE MCCRACKEN DISASTER:
	∙	Trade Allen Lopez (bad year, fine) AND Antonio Castro (CAREER YEAR)
	∙	Get: Jeremy McCracken (33yo lefty, 9-14, 3.81 ERA)
	∙	EVERYONE IS ASKING: WHY NOT JUST BRING BACK BENJI DILLON FOR $12.5M???
FEBRUARY 22ND — THE CLOSER SWAP:
	∙	Trade Edmundo Peña (our 5x All-Star closer), Ross Cabral, Reggie McGregor
	∙	Get: Mariano Rosales (26yo, unproven)
	∙	Peña had 42 saves, 4 blown. Rosales had 38 saves, 5 blown. WE TRADED THE BETTER CLOSER.
THE MANAGER SITUATION:
	∙	Mike Kindler’s contract expired (105-57 season, lost ALCS)
	∙	We hire DEACON SEYMOUR — WHO HAS NEVER MANAGED A GAME
	∙	3 years, $7.6M per year
	∙	FOR A TEAM FULL OF VETERANS IN A CHAMPIONSHIP WINDOW
THEORY: Paulson is leaving. He KNOWS he’s leaving. So he’s making massive moves that look like “win-now” but are actually “burn it down and leave before anyone realizes what happened.”
The Coles trade? Desperate. The McCracken trade? Inexplicable. The Tavares contract? FRANCHISE-CRIPPLING.
And where is Paulson right now? IN CHICAGO HAVING DINNER WITH BULLS PLAYERS.
Connect. The. Dots.

SECTION 5: SPORTS
ANTHONY — The Analyst
“Offseason Efficiency Analysis: When Desperation Meets Asset Management”
Let me break down Oakland’s offseason using objective trade value metrics:
The Travis Coles Acquisition (November 10th):
Assets Out:
	∙	George Whiteley: Top-15 prospect, 95 mph fastball, A-potential SP
	∙	Agustin Rodriguez: 86 overall, career year (.243/.300/.422 with elite defense)
	∙	Cy Newell: Proven MLB performance, 2.95 ERA in emergency role
	∙	Peter Busch: 86 overall, .259/.303/.452 career, playoff power
Assets In:
	∙	Travis Coles: 21yo, 94 overall, 13-8, 2.05 ERA, 207 K in 2040
Trade Value Assessment: Oakland paid approximately 28 WAR projection over next 3 years to acquire 12 WAR projection. The premium? Certainty and age.
Coles is a Paul Skenes-level talent (similar 2027 trade) but younger. If he trends to 98 overall by 2042, this trade becomes neutral. If he plateaus at 94, Oakland overpaid by 40%.
The Jeremy McCracken Trade (February 15th):
This one is harder to justify analytically.
Assets Out:
	∙	Allen Lopez: 84 overall, down year (4.27 ERA), but historically solid (3.83 career ERA)
	∙	Antonio Castro: 79 overall, career year (.270/.360/.400)
Assets In:
	∙	Jeremy McCracken: 33yo, 9-14, 3.81 ERA, declining velocity
Efficiency Rating: Negative 60%.
Oakland needed a lefty. But McCracken’s age curve suggests regression, not stability. Lopez + Castro projects to 4.2 WAR combined. McCracken projects to 1.8 WAR.
Why not re-sign Benji Dillon at $12.5M? He finished 2nd in Cy Young voting (17-6, 3.55 ERA). Even at 38 years old with declining overall (75), Dillon’s leadership + performance > McCracken’s uncertainty.
The Eric Tavares Contract (November 24th):
7 years, $32.1M AAV for a 25-year-old 2B coming off .237/31 HR/92 RBI.
Contract Efficiency Analysis:
	∙	Years 1-3: Overpay by $8M annually (fair value: $24M for this production)
	∙	Years 4-5: Potentially neutral if development continues
	∙	Years 6-7: High risk of negative value (age 31-32 locked at $32M)
Oakland is betting Tavares develops like Isley Kelley did (signed at 25, became perennial All-Star). But Kelley hit .242 in his acquisition year with superior defensive metrics. Tavares hit .237 with average defense.
The Mariano Rosales Trade (February 22nd):
Trading a proven 5x All-Star closer (Edmundo Peña: 42 SV, 4 BS) for an unproven 26-year-old (Rosales: 38 SV, 5 BS) is age-curve management. Analytically sound IF Rosales maintains performance.
But Oakland included Ross Cabral (catching depth, 96 DUR) and Reggie McGregor. That’s overpayment for marginal upgrade.
The Deacon Seymour Hire:
Zero managerial experience. $7.6M AAV. Three-year commitment.
Oakland’s veteran core (Kelley, Keane, Richards, Horn, Davis) doesn’t need development management—they need tactical expertise and clubhouse authority.
Seymour may be brilliant. But this is a high-variance hire for a low-variance situation.
Aggregate Offseason Assessment:
Total WAR projection change: -4.2 over next 2 seasons
If Coles ascends: +8 WAR (net positive)
If Tavares develops: +3 WAR (net neutral)
If either falters: Dynasty window closes by 2042.
Oakland is betting on youth development during a championship window built on veteran stability. That’s not synergy. That’s desperation disguised as strategy.

P SLAYER — Fan Voice Column
“They Broke Up the Band and Told Us It’s an Upgrade”
I don’t know how to process this offseason, so I’m just going to scream into the void and hope someone hears me.
CY NEWELL IS GONE.
The kid who saved our season when Allen Lopez fell apart. The kid who went 3-1 with a 2.95 ERA as a mid-season call-up. The kid who pitched 6 innings with 5 strikeouts in ALCS Game 5 when we were fighting for our lives.
Gone. Traded for Travis Coles, who is great, yes, but CY NEWELL SAVED US.
AGUSTIN RODRIGUEZ IS GONE.
Had a career year. Hit a 3-run homer in ALDS Game 1 when we were trying not to choke. Played his heart out.
Gone. For Travis Coles.
PETER BUSCH IS GONE.
Homered twice in ALDS Game 3. Homered twice in ALCS Game 6 when we needed  complete game shutout from Henry Rivas just to stay alive.
Gone. For Travis Coles.
EDMUNDO PEÑA IS GONE.
Five-time All-Star. OUR CLOSER. Forty-two saves last year. The guy who shut the door for a decade.
Gone. For a 26-year-old with five blown saves.
BENJI DILLON ISN’T COMING BACK.
Finished 2nd in Cy Young voting. Came back to Oakland on a one-year deal to give us one more shot. Pitched a shutout in ALCS Game 4 to keep us alive.
We replaced him with a 33-year-old who went 9-14.
ANTONIO CASTRO IS GONE.
Had a career year. We traded him for the 9-14 guy.
I don’t understand the plan. Anthony can give you the WAR projections and efficiency metrics. I can only tell you this feels like watching your family get traded away one piece at a time while someone tells you it’s an “organizational philosophy shift.”
We went 105-57. We took Boston to seven games. We were RIGHT THERE.
And instead of running it back with the core that got us there, we’re betting on a 21-year-old ace, a .237-hitting second baseman on a SEVEN-YEAR CONTRACT, and a manager who’s never managed a game.
Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe Coles becomes the next Benji Dillon. Maybe Tavares becomes the next Isley Kelley. Maybe Deacon Seymour is a tactical genius.
Or maybe Mike Paulson is in Chicago eating dinner with basketball players while Oakland burns.
I miss Cy. I miss Agustin’s clutch gene. I miss Busch’s playoff power. I miss Peña’s dominance. I miss believing we knew what we were doing.
2041 starts in spring. I’ll be there Opening Day. I’ll wear my Kelley jersey. I’ll cheer for Coles and Tavares and this team that looks nothing like the team I loved.
But I won’t pretend this doesn’t hurt.

HAL RICHMOND — Senior Historian
“The Dismantling: When Championships Require Sacrifice”
Every dynasty ends. The question is whether it ends through entropy—slow decline, aging cores, diminishing returns—or through surgical intervention: trading away pieces while they still have value.
Oakland chose surgery.
The 2040 Athletics went 105-57 and lost Game 7 of the ALCS at home. They were close. Maddeningly close. One more pitcher, one more clutch hit, one less injury to Darrin Davis—any of those changes the outcome.
Instead of addressing those margins, Oakland dismantled the foundation.
The Cy Newell trade makes baseball sense: he’s 26, cost-controlled through 2042, and posted a 2.95 ERA across his callup. But he’s also unproven across a full season. George Whiteley was the #13 prospect in baseball. Agustin Rodriguez had a career year defensively. Peter Busch hit .259 with playoff power.
That’s not a trade. That’s a liquidation.
The return—Travis Coles—is legitimately special. At 21, with a 94 overall rating and a 2.05 ERA across 207 innings, he’s reminiscent of Paul Skenes in the 2027 trade that helped build this dynasty. If Coles ascends to 98 overall, this trade becomes the foundation of the next era.
But dynasties aren’t built on “if.”
The Jeremy McCracken acquisition is harder to defend historically. Oakland needed a lefty after declining to re-sign Benji Dillon, who finished 2nd in Cy Young voting at age 38. Instead, they traded Allen Lopez (career 3.83 ERA) and Antonio Castro (career year) for McCracken, a 33-year-old with declining velocity.
Benji wanted $12.5M for one year. McCracken cost two roster pieces and likely performs worse. The logic escapes me.
The Eric Tavares signing—seven years, $32.1M annually—is a bet on development during a win-now window. Tavares hit .237 last year. He’s 25, which means Oakland is paying for ages 25-31. That’s either brilliant foresight or catastrophic misallocation.
Compare to Isley Kelley, signed at 25 in a similar deal. Kelley became a perennial MVP candidate. But Kelley hit .242 with elite defense in his acquisition year. Tavares hit .237 with average defense. The gap matters.
The Deacon Seymour hire might be the boldest move. Mike Kindler went 105-57 and lost his job because the organization wanted… what, exactly? Youth? Innovation? Seymour has never managed a game. He’s the “hottest name on the market,” but hot doesn’t mean proven.
Oakland’s veteran core—Isley Kelley (14 years service time), Vinnie Keane (15 years), Mark Aitken, Danny Horn—doesn’t need a development-focused manager. They need a tactician who understands October pressure.
Seymour may be brilliant. Or he may learn on the job while the championship window narrows.
Edmundo Peña’s departure closes a chapter. Five All-Star appearances. Forty-two saves in 2040. Traded for Mariano Rosales, who’s 26 and unproven in October. The
move makes age-curve sense—Peña is 37, trending downward. But Peña was our closer. The guy who shut the door during three championships.
Trading him for future value means the organization believes the window is longer than one year. Trading Cy, Agustin, Busch, and Whiteley suggests the opposite: they believe they need Coles now.
Which is it? Win now or build for 2042-2045?
The offseason doesn’t answer that question. It just creates more.
I’ve covered this franchise for fifteen years. I’ve seen them build dynasties and dismantle them. This feels like both happening simultaneously—tearing down the 2037-2040 core while betting on a 2041-2044 window that may not exist if Coles, Tavares, or Seymour falters.
Mike Paulson may be in Chicago by spring. If he is, this offseason will be remembered as his final act: bold, controversial, and impossible to evaluate until 2042.
I hope he’s right. Because if he’s wrong, Oakland just traded away a championship window for a blueprint that never materializes.
