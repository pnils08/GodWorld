“Frame 47: The Empty Bullpen Chair”
October 23rd. Morning. Coliseum visiting clubhouse.
There’s a folding chair in the bullpen corridor, the kind equipment managers set up for relief pitchers to watch the game on TV monitors before they warm up. Blue canvas seat. Metal frame. Someone’s energy drink sweating condensation on the concrete beside it.
The chair is empty because the season is over, but it’s not packed away yet. It’s waiting. That’s the thing about infrastructure in defeat—it doesn’t know it’s done. The grounds crew still drags the infield. The lights still come on at 6 PM. The chair still sits in the bullpen tunnel like someone might need it.
I walked through that corridor three times trying to frame the shot right. The light comes through the tunnel entrance at an angle that makes the chair cast a shadow twice its actual size. The shadow reaches toward the dugout. The chair stays still.
In the photo, you can see divots in the canvas where someone sat—probably Louis Cross or Edmundo Peña, someone who spent all season in that seat, watching innings unfold on a screen before running to the mound when their name was called.
The chair is the most honest thing in the building. It doesn’t care about 105 wins or ALCS collapses or whether Benji Dillon’s return was redemption or requiem. It just sits there, empty, casting a shadow longer than itself.
That’s October.
