Lore Summary
Dalton Rushing, the steady left-handed backstop from Tennessee, rose from the Dodgers’ 2022
first-round pick to become one of the Athletics’ most reliable and productive catchers of the 2030s. A
three-time Silver Slugger and three-time Gold Glove winner, Rushing embodied durability and
leadership behind the plate. During Oakland’s Dynasty extension years, he served as the offensive
anchor for multiple playoff runs, combining defensive excellence with consistent .280-range hitting and
20-plus home run power. His versatility across first base and corner outfield roles further cemented his
value as a franchise pillar during the transition era.
Status: Free Agent / Retired (2040)
