Paper Cuts vs. Percentiles

Back then, greatness had to shout to be heard. In the print age, the story wasn’t just what the Oakland clubhouse did across a summer; it was what a columnist could fit above the fold. Swagger got ink. Scuffles got headlines. Three straight crowns could be reduced to a mood, a mustache, or a myth. The game was loud, but the box score was quiet—numbers ended at batting average, runs batted in, and earned run average. If you wanted to argue dynasty, you argued personality.

Fast‑forward to our 2030s clubhouse. The noise is still there—only now it has to stand next to evidence. Win probability added, run value on edge‑painted heaters, catcher exchange times down to the tenth, even route efficiency in center—every hunch meets a histogram. A cold week is context, not crisis; a hot month is signal, not folklore. You can’t bury a champion under a headline when their percentile ranks are ten paragraphs deep.

Here’s the twist: perception still shapes legacy. Yesterday’s bias crowned or crushed by vibe; today’s bias blesses whatever the model measures best. The old A’s were judged by ink and incident; our squad is weighed by decimals and dashboards. Same question across two eras: what proves “great”? Back then, it was myth that survived Monday. Now, it’s value that survives scrutiny.

So call it what it is: paper cuts vs. percentiles. One team fought narratives; the other audits them. Either way, greatness keeps receipts—first on newsprint, now in code.
