BAYLIGHT CLEARS PLANNING COMMITTEE: 4-1 VOTE ADVANCES STADIUM PROJECT

Conditions attached, but the path forward is open

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

OAKLAND — The City Planning Committee voted 4-1 Thursday evening to advance the Baylight District proposal to environmental review, clearing the first formal approval gate for the $2.8 billion waterfront development.

The vote came with conditions — enhanced environmental monitoring, quarterly community benefit compliance reports, expanded traffic mitigation studies — but the project moves forward. The single dissenting vote cited concerns about the rushed timeline given the absence of key civic officials.

Committee Chair Helen Vasquez called the session to order at 6:15 PM, just as First Friday crowds began filling Temescal and KONO galleries a few miles north. By 8:47 PM, after two hours of public comment and committee deliberation, the gavel fell.

“This is not an endorsement,” Vasquez said in her closing remarks. “This is a procedural advancement contingent on rigorous environmental review. The work begins now.”

Mayor Avery Santana released a statement within minutes: “Oakland took a step forward tonight. Private investment, public benefit, community oversight. The framework is sound. Now we prove it.”

The conditions attached to the approval include: mandatory quarterly reports to the Baylight Community Benefits Board, enhanced stormwater and harbor ecosystem monitoring beyond state CEQA requirements, traffic modeling for both game-day and non-game scenarios, and an accelerated affordable housing timeline that front-loads the 1,800 deed-restricted units.

Keisha Ramos, the Baylight Authority Director, called the conditions “reasonable and workable.”

“We anticipated rigorous oversight,” Ramos said. “That’s what this process is designed to provide. We’re prepared to meet every requirement.”

The dissenting vote came from Committee Member David Chen, who expressed concern about proceeding while Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei — the city’s lead stadium negotiator — remains hospitalized, and Business Caucus Leader Elliott Crane is still listed as injured.

“This project deserves full deliberation by a fully staffed civic apparatus,” Chen said. “I’m not voting against the project. I’m voting against the timing.”

Chief of Staff Laila Cortez, handling interim stadium duties during Osei’s recovery, attended the session but did not speak publicly.

The project now enters environmental impact review, expected to run through Cycle 82. Public comment opens in Cycle 78. The final City Council vote is projected for Cycle 83.

One vote down. The real work begins.

MIGRATION REVERSES: +50 AFTER MONTHS OF BLEEDING

For the first time in cycles, more people are arriving than leaving

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Investigations

OAKLAND — The number that defined Oakland’s anxiety for months has flipped.

Migration drift hit +50 this cycle — the first positive reading since tracking began, and a 95-point swing from the -45 recorded just one cycle ago.

More people moved into Oakland than moved out. For the first time in recent memory, the city is growing.

The reversal coincides with the Baylight District rendering release, the Planning Committee advancement, and a sentiment reading that hit the highest level tracked. Whether correlation or causation remains unclear, but the narrative has shifted.

“I moved here last month,” said Tariq Jordan, 43, who relocated from Sacramento. “The stadium project, the waterfront — it feels like Oakland is building something. I wanted to be part of it.”

The previous six cycles saw steady population loss, with West Oakland bearing the heaviest burden. Migration drift readings of -45, -35, -36 painted a picture of a city emptying out. Families packing trucks. Storefronts going dark.

This cycle, the trucks are arriving.

Fruitvale and Temescal saw the strongest inflow. Both neighborhoods registered positive demographic markers for the first time since the health crisis began. Downtown, previously labeled a “civic pressure zone,” now reads as “calm-after-shock.”

City Manager Aaron Whitfield cautioned against over-interpretation.

“One cycle does not establish a trend,” Whitfield said. “We’ve seen positive readings before that didn’t sustain. What matters is the next six cycles, not the last one.”

But on the streets, the mood has shifted. The Bay Tribune spoke with three residents who arrived within the past two cycles:

“Oakland felt like a place that wanted me,” said Sofia Jordan, 53, Fruitvale. “The city has problems. Every city has problems. But it’s trying.”

“I came for a job,” said Marcus Nguyen, 27, Temescal. “I’m staying because the neighborhood feels alive.”

“First Friday tonight,” said Kaila Brown, 52, Grand Lake. “I’ve been to art walks in a dozen cities. This one has something.”

The +50 reading doesn’t erase the losses. West Oakland’s population is still down. The health arc in Temescal still registers elevated. Downtown’s shock flag hasn’t fully cleared.

But for one cycle, at least, Oakland is gaining ground.

FIRST FRIDAY SPECIAL
############################################################

THE CITY COMES OUT: FIRST FRIDAY FILLS OAKLAND’S STREETS

Art walks, galleries, and the first night of Pride Month converge

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

OAKLAND — The weather was perfect. The crowds showed up. And Oakland remembered what it feels like to celebrate.

First Friday landed on a 69-degree evening with a gentle breeze — the kind of night that makes outdoor art walks feel like destiny rather than planning. From Temescal to KONO to Uptown, galleries opened their doors, street vendors lined the sidewalks, and the city’s nightlife volume hit its highest reading in months.

“This is the Oakland I moved here for,” said Brianna Harris, 48, standing outside a Temescal gallery showing local photographers. “People out. Art everywhere. Strangers talking to strangers.”

The convergence with Pride Month added another layer. Rainbow flags appeared in storefronts across multiple neighborhoods. Several galleries featured LGBTQ+ artists. The energy felt intentional — Oakland choosing to be itself.

At the Lake Merritt First Friday Art Market, vendors reported brisk traffic through the evening hours. Local artists showcased work to audiences that seemed genuinely engaged rather than just passing through.

“I’ve done this market for three years,” said one vendor who asked not to be named. “Tonight felt different. People were buying, not just looking. Something shifted.”

The nightlife numbers support the observation. Volume hit 10 — the maximum tracked — with movement patterns described as “art-walk” rather than the “restricted” readings from previous cycles. Temescal, Downtown, and Uptown all registered elevated activity. Jack London buzzed with waterfront crowds spilling out of restaurants.

Fruitvale’s Community Action Day ran concurrently, drawing residents to neighborhood organizing sessions that had been scheduled as an “emergency briefing” after the Downtown shock events. Attendance exceeded expectations.

“We came to talk about problems,” said one Fruitvale resident. “We ended up celebrating solutions. The briefing became a block party.”

Pride Month kicks off with this energy as its foundation. The cultural calendar shows elevated programming through the month — gallery openings, community events, visibility celebrations.

For one night, at least, Oakland felt like itself again.

TEMESCAL: FIRST FRIDAY ARTS WALK ZONE

Neighborhood sentiment hits +1.05 as galleries draw record crowds

By Marla Keen | Bay Tribune Community

TEMESCAL — The neighborhood that’s been at the center of Oakland’s health crisis had a different story to tell Friday night.

Galleries packed. Restaurants overflowing. The art walk crowds that define First Friday returned in force, pushing Temescal’s event attractiveness to its highest reading this year.

The health arc hasn’t disappeared. Clinics still report elevated monitoring. Community mutual aid networks remain active. But for one evening, Temescal chose to be about something other than crisis.

“We’ve been watching numbers for weeks,” said one cafe owner on Telegraph Avenue. “Tonight we watched people. It felt good.”

The neighborhood’s sentiment reading hit +1.05 — among the highest in the city. Retail vitality registered positive. The demographic marker shifted from crisis-language to “First Friday arts walk zone.”

Night Owl Den, a Temescal spot that’s been quiet during the health concerns, reported its busiest evening in memory.

“People needed this,” said a bartender. “We all needed this.”

The tension isn’t gone. Residents still discuss symptoms, still share information, still watch their neighbors for signs. But Friday night’s crowds suggest something important: Temescal isn’t defined by what’s wrong. It’s defined by what it builds.

FRUITVALE COMMUNITY ACTION DAY EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS

Scheduled “emergency briefing” becomes neighborhood celebration

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

FRUITVALE — The signs said “Emergency Town Briefing.” The event felt like a block party.

Fruitvale Community Action Day — scheduled in Cycle 73 as a response to the Downtown shock events and civic office absences — drew hundreds of residents to neighborhood organizing sessions Friday evening. What started as crisis response became something closer to community celebration.

“We had an agenda,” said one organizer. “Then we had people. The people changed the agenda.”

The briefing was originally planned to address questions about the shock flag that hit Downtown, the hospitalization of Deputy Mayor Osei, and the ongoing health concerns across multiple neighborhoods. Residents arrived expecting updates and explanations.

They got those — Chief of Staff Laila Cortez sent a representative with prepared remarks on civic operations during Osei’s recovery — but they also got something else: neighbors meeting neighbors, organizations sharing resources, community bonds forming in real time.

“I came to ask questions,” said Elena Lopez, 51, Fruitvale. “I left with three new people to call if I need help. That’s better than any answer the city could give.”

The neighborhood’s sentiment reading held at +1.0 despite the serious topics discussed. Fruitvale’s event attractiveness registered positive. Demographic markers showed “stable” — a shift from the uncertainty that prompted the briefing.

Whether the Community Action Day model spreads to other neighborhoods remains to be seen. But Friday night demonstrated something important: Oakland knows how to turn crisis into connection.

OSEI UPDATE: “MAKING PROGRESS”

Cortez provides status during Planning Committee session

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

Chief of Staff Laila Cortez confirmed Thursday that Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei continues recovery from the traffic collision that hospitalized him in Cycle 72.

“He’s making progress,” Cortez said in brief remarks before the Planning Committee session. “He’s engaged. He’s asking questions. He’s Marcus.”

Cortez did not provide a timeline for Osei’s return to civic duties but confirmed he has been briefed on the Baylight Committee vote.

Elliott Crane, the Business Caucus Leader also hospitalized since Cycle 72, remains listed as “injured” with no public update on his condition.

BULLS HIT 28-11: BEST START IN FRANCHISE HISTORY

NBA Cup champions rolling through regular season

By Selena Grant | Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The Bulls aren’t slowing down.

At 28-11, Chicago owns the best record in the Eastern Conference and the best start in franchise history since the Jordan era. The NBA Cup trophy sits in a case at the United Center. The young core that won it is playing even better.

Josh Giddey’s triple-double average continues. Hank Trepagnier — the rookie center who put up 24 points and 18 rebounds in the Cup Finals — has taken the starting job from Walker Kessler and hasn’t looked back. Matas Buzelis is developing into a legitimate two-way threat. Adash Stanley comes off the bench and immediately changes games.

“We’re ahead of schedule,” GM Mike Paulson said after a recent win. “But we’re not surprised. This group works.”

The Walker Kessler trade rumors have quieted since the Cup run, but his role has diminished. He’s a rotation piece now, not a building block. The front office continues to accumulate draft picks — a strategy that suggests Paulson isn’t done building.

The next game is against Detroit. The schedule gets tougher in February. But right now, Chicago is the story of the NBA’s first half.

WARRIORS WANT PAULSON: GOLDEN STATE OWNERSHIP PURSUING A’S GM

Oakland rumors swirl as Chicago dominates

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

OAKLAND — The Golden State Warriors want Mike Paulson.

Multiple sources confirm that Warriors ownership has reached out to the dual-franchise GM about taking over basketball operations in Oakland. The Warriors sit 19-20, ninth in the Western Conference, with Steph Curry’s prime years ticking away.

Paulson’s Bulls are 28-11. The contrast is stark.

“There’s interest,” one source confirmed. “Real interest. Ownership level.”

The timing is complicated. Paulson just told Oakland media that the city is “home” — where he plans to “raise my family and retire someday.” He’s managing the A’s through spring training, the Baylight District negotiations, and a dynasty celebration season. Adding a third franchise seems impossible.

But the Warriors aren’t asking him to leave Chicago. They’re asking him to come home — to Oakland, where he already operates, where the stadium deal he’s championing would reshape the waterfront.

Paulson has not commented publicly on the Warriors interest.

The Bulls, meanwhile, continue winning. If Paulson were removed from Chicago in his first season after building a championship-caliber roster, the optics would be extraordinary.

For now, it’s a rumor. But in a city where Paulson’s presence is already a question mark, another Oakland franchise wanting him adds another layer to an already complicated story.

A’S SPRING TRAINING: SEYMOUR’S FIRST GAME APPROACHES

Oakland opens against San Diego as 2041 season begins to take shape

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

MESA, ARIZONA — The countdown is almost over.

Deacon Seymour will manage his first professional baseball game when the A’s open spring training against the San Diego Padres. It’s the moment everyone’s been waiting for — and dreading, depending on who you ask.

Seymour has never managed a professional game. He was the hottest name on the market this offseason, hired to replace the departed Mike Kindler, given a three-year contract worth $7.6 million annually. The veterans in the clubhouse have more experience than he does.

But Paulson is confident. “I’m a huge fan of Deacon,” he said at his Oakland presser. “I understand the concerns but I’m confident in his abilities.”

The roster is loaded. Danny Horn — who Paulson endorsed as “the best player in the league” — anchors center field. Darrin Davis returns from his ACL injury ready for at-bats. Vinnie Keane begins his farewell season at third base. The rotation features two aces in Henry Rivas and Travis Coles, with Benji Dillon slotting into the five spot for his dynasty celebration year.

The pitching depth Paulson emphasized is real: Mariano Rosales takes over as closer, a 26-year-old with 38 saves last season. The bullpen is “uber talented,” per Paulson.

What remains unknown is whether Seymour can manage it. Spring training will provide the first answers. The veterans are watching. The fans are watching. Paulson says he’ll be there — three days a week in Mesa, just like he promised.

First pitch against San Diego. Seymour’s journey begins.

TEMESCAL HEALTH ARC: CALM AFTER THE STORM

Clinics report stable readings as neighborhood celebrates First Friday

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Bay Tribune Health Desk

TEMESCAL — The pattern flag shifted this cycle from “elevated-activity” to “calm-after-shock.”

Temescal’s health indicators remain elevated — clinics continue monitoring, community mutual aid networks stay active — but the acute phase appears to have passed. The illness rate that drove five weeks of concern has stabilized.

“We’re not declaring victory,” said one clinic coordinator who asked not to be named. “But we’re not in crisis mode either. That’s progress.”

The neighborhood’s sentiment reading hit +1.05, the highest in the city. First Friday crowds filled the streets. The health arc that dominated coverage for weeks shared space with art walks and gallery openings.

Dr. Patricia Nwosu, the Alameda County Deputy Health Officer who publicly rebuked Mike Paulson for his unauthorized health crisis prediction, has not issued a public statement this cycle. County health communications have returned to standard protocols.

The shock flag that appeared in Downtown during Cycle 72 remains active but diminished. The “unexplained” classification that prompted the Fruitvale Emergency Briefing has not been updated.

For now, Oakland breathes. The health arc isn’t over, but the worst appears to have passed.

PRIDE MONTH BEGINS: OAKLAND CELEBRATES VISIBILITY

Rainbow flags appear across neighborhoods as cultural programming expands

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

OAKLAND — Pride Month opened with First Friday, and Oakland chose to make a statement.

Rainbow flags appeared in storefronts from Temescal to Jack London to Downtown. Several galleries featured LGBTQ+ artists in their First Friday exhibitions. The cultural calendar shows elevated programming throughout June — visibility celebrations, community events, art openings with Pride themes.

“This city knows how to show up,” said one gallery owner in KONO. “Pride isn’t a marketing event here. It’s who we are.”

The convergence with First Friday amplified the energy. Crowds that came for art walks stayed for Pride visibility. Neighborhoods that struggled through health concerns and civic uncertainty chose to celebrate identity and community.

Oakland’s Pride history runs deep. The city has hosted celebrations for decades, weathered challenges, and emerged stronger. This year’s Pride Month begins with the city in an unusual position: migration reversing, stadium project advancing, sentiment at its highest reading.

It’s not a perfect moment. The health arc persists. Civic offices remain understaffed. The economy still shows strain in some neighborhoods.

But Pride has always been about celebrating through imperfection. Oakland knows how to do that.

OPINION

THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports — Senior Historian

+50.

That’s it. That’s the number.

For months, we’ve watched Oakland bleed. Migration drift readings of -30, -35, -45. Families leaving. Storefronts closing. The narrative of a city in decline.

This cycle: +50. More people arrived than left.

I’ve been covering Oakland for forty years. I’ve seen booms and busts, championships and heartbreaks, promises made and broken. I’ve learned not to trust single data points.

But +50 matters.

It matters because narrative creates reality. When people believe a city is dying, they leave. When they believe it’s building something, they stay. The Baylight rendering showed a vision. The Planning Committee vote showed a path. The migration number showed people responding.

Is it sustainable? I don’t know. One cycle doesn’t establish a trend. The health arc isn’t over. The civic offices are still short-staffed. The hard work of building a stadium and a neighborhood and a future hasn’t even started.

But +50 means something. It means Oakland stopped losing ground, at least for one cycle. It means people are choosing to be here.

That’s not nothing. In a city that’s been watching itself shrink, that’s everything.

FIRST FRIDAY FELT DIFFERENT

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

I’ve been going to First Friday for years. The art walks. The crowds. The feeling of Oakland being Oakland.

But Friday night felt different.

Maybe it was the weather — 69 degrees, perfect breeze, the kind of evening that makes you want to stay outside forever. Maybe it was the Planning Committee vote, the sense that something real was happening. Maybe it was Pride Month beginning, the rainbow flags adding color to an already colorful night.

Or maybe it was simpler than that. Maybe Oakland just needed a good night.

The migration number hit +50. People are moving here again. The rendering showed a stadium on the water. The committee said yes. The crowds filled Temescal and KONO and Uptown like they used to, before the health crisis, before the civic absences, before the uncertainty.

I talked to people who’d just moved here. They came for jobs, for community, for the thing Oakland has that other cities don’t. They came because they believed in something.

That’s what Friday night felt like. Belief.

It won’t last. The hard times will come back. They always do. But Friday night, walking through Temescal with art on every wall and strangers becoming friends — that felt like the Oakland I fell in love with.

One good night. Sometimes that’s enough.

*The Tribune received strong response to First Friday coverage. A selection:*

-----

**“Finally, a reason to stay”**

I was packing boxes. I’m not kidding. The migration numbers, the health crisis, the feeling that Oakland was emptying out — I was ready to go. Then the rendering dropped. Then the vote passed. Then I walked through Temescal on Friday night and remembered why I moved here. Boxes are unpacked. I’m staying.
— Lorenzo Lewis, 26, Downtown

-----

**“One vote doesn’t fix everything”**

The Planning Committee said yes with conditions. Great. Now show me the environmental review passes. Show me the Council vote passes. Show me the stadium actually gets built and the jobs actually go to Oakland residents. I’ve been here too long to celebrate procedural votes.
— Ariana Reyes, 35, San Antonio

-----

**“Pride Month means something here”**

I moved from Texas last year. The rainbow flags in windows, the galleries showing queer artists, the feeling that visibility is celebrated rather than tolerated — that’s not everywhere. That’s Oakland. Happy Pride.
— Marcus Harris, 38, Temescal

-----

**“The health arc isn’t over”**

Everyone’s celebrating First Friday and the stadium vote. My neighbor is still sick. The clinics are still monitoring. The “calm after shock” reading doesn’t mean the shock is explained. Keep watching Temescal.
