Adash Stanely wasn’t supposed to be here.

Not on an NBA roster. Not crossing over Luka Dončić. Not finishing with 26 points on a Sunday afternoon while 20,000 people screamed his name.

The 19-year-old from Kraków, Poland went undrafted. Every team passed. Mike Paulson didn’t.

“I saw the hustle rating,” Paulson said after acquiring Stanley from the G League in October. “Ninety-nine. You can’t teach that.”

Stanley stands 6’2”, 180 pounds. He’s not the biggest point guard, not the fastest, not the most skilled. But he plays every possession like it’s his last.

“In Poland, basketball is not the first sport,” Stanley said through an interpreter when he first arrived. “Football. Hockey. Then maybe basketball. I had to fight for everything.”

He’s still fighting. Teammates say he’s “Laid Back” off the court — reading Polish literature, exploring Chicago’s Eastern European restaurants. On the court, he transforms.

“He’s got A potential,” one Bulls scout said. “The question was always whether he’d get the chance to show it.”

He’s showing it.
