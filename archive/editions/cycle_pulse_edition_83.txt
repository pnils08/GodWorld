**$2.1 BILLION. 6-3. SIGNED.**

**Council approves Baylight District bond in Oakland's largest-ever municipal financing commitment — but two legal instruments remain unfinished, and construction cannot begin**

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Ledger

Elena Reyes has lived on the Downtown waterfront for eleven years, in a two-bedroom on Clay Street three blocks from where the Baylight District's 65-acre footprint would begin. On the night the council voted, she sat in her car in the parking structure on 3rd Street and listened to the broadcast on her phone — two-minute public comments, council deliberations, the final roll call — from start to finish.

"I didn't go in," she said the next morning. "I couldn't sit in there. But I needed to hear every word."

The Oakland City Council voted 6-3 Tuesday night to approve the $2.1 billion Baylight District development bond, authorizing the largest single public financing commitment in Oakland's modern municipal history. Mayor Avery Santana signed the measure within hours of the vote closing.

The project — a mixed-use waterfront development anchored by a 35,000-seat open-air stadium, 3,200 residential units, and expanded marina access — has been building toward this vote for years. But the resolution that emerged from the council chamber Tuesday was not a final green light. It was, in the language of the city's own legal counsel, a conditional authorization.

**The Vote**

The 6-3 breakdown held few surprises by faction — but one vote was watched more closely than any other.

Four members of the Oakland Progressive Caucus voted yes: Denise Carter (D1), Rose Delgado (D3), Janae Rivers (D5), and Terrence Mobley (D9). The Civic Reform Coalition's three members — Elliott Crane (D6), Warren Ashford (D7), and Nina Chen (D8) — voted no, holding together as a unified bloc for the second consecutive major vote after their shared opposition on last week's Alternative Response Initiative.

The swing votes belonged to the two independents: Leonard Tran (D2) and Ramon Vega (D4). Both voted yes.

Tran's yes vote was consistent with his position on the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative, which he supported last week. Vega's was not. Vega was among the four members who voted against OARI, citing accountability concerns about implementation timelines and oversight structures. That he voted yes on a $2.1 billion instrument with a twelve-year phased development window — longer and more complex than any OARI rollout — will be scrutinized.

Crane, still recovering from an injury that has kept him out of chambers since late spring, participated remotely. His no vote arrived by videolink.

Ashford voted no despite representing District 7, which borders the Temescal corridor where he also opposed the community health center appropriation two months ago. The CRC has now voted in unified opposition on two consecutive major initiatives — OARI and Baylight. Before that, the coalition was split on the Stabilization Fund, where Crane crossed to vote yes, and incomplete on the Health Center vote, where Crane was absent.

**What Passed — and What Didn't**

The bond authorization covers the full project scope: stadium, 1,800 deed-restricted affordable units out of 3,200 total residential, retail and commercial space, marina expansion, and public open space along the water. Financing is structured through future tax increment revenue generated by the development itself.

But two instruments essential to that financing structure were not finalized when the council voted.

Dr. Simone Ellis, the city's Legal Counsel, confirmed that the tax increment financing legislative language had not been completed as of the vote. The approval may carry conditions pending that finalization.

Keisha Ramos, Director of the Baylight Redevelopment Authority, acknowledged separately that a remediation bonding instrument — required to cover soil excavation costs on the waterfront parcel — has not yet been executed. Under the project's terms, construction mobilization cannot begin until that instrument is in place.

The city completed the Draft Environmental Impact Report's public circulation period ahead of the vote, with comments on traffic mitigation, sea-level rise projections, and construction emissions submitted by residents and advocacy organizations. Under CEQA, those comments must be formally responded to in a final EIR. A procedural challenge to the review window could affect the project's timeline independent of the council's approval.

Ramos said the authority is "moving quickly" to resolve the outstanding instruments but declined to specify a completion date.

**The Waterfront Question**

Reyes, who submitted a letter to the council three weeks ago outlining concerns about construction traffic and displacement pressure on Clay Street's existing tenants, said Tuesday's vote left her with more questions than relief.

"I read the project documents. I attended the hearings. I know what 1,800 affordable units means on paper," she said. "What I don't know is whether the people already living here get any of them, or whether they're priced for people who can already afford to stay."

She paused. "They said the comments were addressed. I want to see what that means in the final EIR."

Public testimony at Tuesday's session was limited to two minutes per speaker. The chamber held roughly 200 people. Several community organizations submitted written comments in advance. Overflow observers watched a live feed in the hallway outside.

The Tribune's count of the vote, corroborated against the council's official roll call, confirmed six yes votes and three no votes. No council member was absent. The required threshold was five votes.

**What Comes Next**

The Baylight Redevelopment Authority now moves to finalize the two outstanding instruments before construction can be mobilized. The twelve-year phased development timeline begins — on paper — from the date of signature.

Ramos has not yet announced a timeline for either the TIF language completion or the remediation instrument. Ellis's office has not released a public notice on the conditions attached to the approval.

Eleven years of covering Oakland City Council has taught Carmen Delaine one thing about timelines. The question isn't whether the vote happened. The question is who's counting the days after.

Oakland passed things this week. That is the headline, and it is true. Six to three on Baylight. Five to four on OARI the week before. The Stabilization Fund months ago. The health center before that. On paper, this city is building something.

But paper is not concrete. And the distance between a council vote and an open door is where Oakland has always been tested.

Carmen walked out of the council chamber Tuesday night and said something I've been thinking about since: "They voted yes. Now what?" That's not cynicism. That's eleven years of watching timelines slip and implementation windows close. The Stabilization Fund hasn't cut a check. OARI hasn't named a pilot district. The health center is in permitting. And Baylight — $2.1 billion of Baylight — cannot break ground until two instruments nobody on that floor mentioned are signed.

Meanwhile, on First Friday, the city showed up. The streets were full. The galleries were open. Jalen Hill had fifteen minutes between shifts and stood on the Jack London waterfront watching his neighborhood be alive. Marcus Walker forgot how many people live here. That's the other Oakland — the one that doesn't wait for permission.

This edition lives in that gap. Between the vote and the shovel. Between the approval and the open door. The city is doing its work. We're watching to see if the work gets done.

### AFTER THE VOTE, THE CLOCK

**OARI's 45-day window opens — the Mayor's office has not yet named a pilot district**

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Ledger

The Oakland Alternative Response Initiative passed on a 5-4 vote last week. Mayor Avery Santana signed it. The $12.5 million behavioral health program — two-person teams of a behavioral health clinician and a peer counselor, deployed on non-violent crisis calls in place of sworn officers — is now law.

Now comes the part Carmen has watched fail before: implementation.

Under the initiative's terms, the Mayor's office has forty-five days from signature to select three pilot districts and begin the hiring process. City Planning is coordinating with the Department of Violence Prevention on facility and vehicle staging. No districts have been announced. No hiring criteria have been released publicly. No timeline for those announcements has been given.

Dante Nelson, 41, works security at a downtown office complex on Franklin Street and has followed the OARI debate since last fall, when Oakland Police Officers Association mailers started appearing in his Adams Point neighborhood targeting the initiative's backers. He supported the program but said the silence since the vote has been noticeable.

"They passed it. Good. But what does that mean for my block?" he said Thursday. "I want to know which districts they're picking first. I want to know what the teams look like. Right now, nothing."

Nelson's concern is not unusual for a program of this scope. OARI's $12.5 million budget breaks down as follows: $8.2 million for personnel, $2.1 million for training, $1.4 million for physical infrastructure — vehicles, staging facilities — and $800,000 for evaluation. Building out that infrastructure across three pilot districts simultaneously requires lead time. The forty-five-day window is not, on its face, generous.

Two factors complicate the timeline. The initiative passed 5-4, meaning the political coalition that got it over the threshold is narrow. Vega, who voted no, represents District 4, which includes the Adams Point neighborhood where the OPOA mailer campaign was concentrated. Whether that district is among the three selected for piloting — and whether Vega's office is consulted in that selection — will signal how the Mayor's office intends to manage a divided council.

Ashford and the CRC voted no on OARI last week and voted no again on Baylight Tuesday — two consecutive major votes where the coalition held as a unified bloc. The CRC's consistent fiscal opposition positions them as the council's primary check on large-scale spending, though whether that coalition holds through Baylight's implementation oversight hearings is a question the next forty-five days will begin to answer.

Forty-five days from the Mayor's signature puts the district selection deadline in mid-summer. The Tribune will report when that announcement comes. If it doesn't come on time, we'll report that too.

### THE $60 MILLION QUESTION NOBODY ASKED ON THE FLOOR

**As council authorized $2.1B for Baylight, Oakland's infrastructure maintenance gap quietly widened**

By Trevor Shimizu | Bay Tribune Transit & Infrastructure

Two weeks ago, on a Tuesday afternoon, a stretch of Telegraph Avenue near 40th Street developed a pavement failure significant enough for a Public Works crew to cone off the right lane. Standard maintenance response. The repair took four days.

This week, the same city government authorized $2.1 billion in development bonding for a waterfront mixed-use project.

These are not the same kind of money. One is capital financing for new construction; the other is operating maintenance for existing infrastructure. But they exist in the same budget ecosystem, and right now that ecosystem has a $60 million hole in it.

Oakland's infrastructure capital budget for the current fiscal year stands at $140 million against an identified maintenance need of approximately $200 million — a gap of $60 million that Public Works has been managing through triage. Water pressure has dropped below standard levels in parts of the KONO district. The Telegraph pavement failure was one of at least three flagged corridor-level surface issues currently in the deferred maintenance queue.

Shawn Nguyen, 43, works construction in Fruitvale and drives Telegraph as part of his daily route. He noticed the cone setup before the repair crew arrived.

"That hole was there for a week before they got to it," he said. "I've been watching that stretch deteriorate for two years. They patch it, it comes back. Nobody's fixing the base."

He's describing deferred maintenance: the practice of addressing surface symptoms while the underlying infrastructure continues to degrade. It is not a failure of competence. It is a math problem. When annual maintenance budgets fall short of annual maintenance needs, crews prioritize by severity and patch what they can. The backlog grows.

Here is the question that was not asked on the council floor Tuesday night: as Oakland assumes a $2.1 billion bonding obligation for new development, what is the plan for the maintenance gap in existing infrastructure?

The answer is not in the Baylight bond documents, which address tax increment financing for new construction only. The answer is not in the infrastructure capital budget, which has held at $140 million without a supplement since the last fiscal cycle. And it was not, based on the Tribune's review of the floor record, raised by any of the nine council members during deliberations.

Jose Wright, 26, an electrician from Temescal who bid on a public works subcontract last spring, said the disconnect between new development investment and infrastructure maintenance is familiar.

"You see it on every big project. The ribbon-cutting money is there. The maintenance money is never there," he said. "You build something new on top of infrastructure that's already behind, and now you've got two problems."

The Baylight District development, if it proceeds on its twelve-year timeline, will add a 35,000-seat stadium, 3,200 residential units, a marina expansion, and new commercial and retail space to a waterfront corridor that currently connects to the city's road and water systems through infrastructure budgeted at 70 cents on the dollar of identified need.

Public Works has not released a projection of what Baylight-related infrastructure integration will require. The city's capital plan through fiscal year 2044 does not appear to include a Baylight-specific infrastructure supplement.

The Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II — a $230 million project whose council vote is expected later this year — will add another demand node to the same regional infrastructure network.

The cones on Telegraph came down. The crew patched the base layer and resurfaced. The repair will hold for a while.

The math will not hold forever.

**Oakland's summer economy is running two tracks at once: announcements that move money on paper, and workers waiting to feel any of it**

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

The council's 6-3 approval of the Baylight bond sends $2.1 billion toward a 65-acre waterfront development at the southern edge of Jack London Square — 3,200 residential units projected, roughly 1,800 of them deed-restricted affordable, alongside commercial space and a marina expansion financed through tax increment mechanisms that will capture rising property values to service the bond debt. For Oakland contractors and construction trades, it is the largest single capital commitment in years. But the remediation bonding instrument required to clear the soil on that waterfront parcel has not yet been executed, which means mobilization cannot begin. The jobs are coming — the question, as always, is when, and which labor pipelines they flow through when they do. Carmen Delaine has the political analysis; the economic signal here is straightforward: a $2.1 billion promise is not a shovel.

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund's disbursement window has been open for weeks. The $28 million authorized in the spring remains uncut. Application review is underway through the Office of Economic and Workforce Development, but no funds have reached recipients yet. I spoke with Darius Clark last month — he works at a bakery in West Oakland, was handed an application form and told to wait. He is still waiting. That patience has a cost: small operators who might have hired summer staff or renegotiated a lease in anticipation of relief have been making decisions in a vacuum. Darius told me then that he was "cautiously hopeful." I didn't call it optimism, and I won't now.

The one place where Oakland's summer economy is moving in real time is Jack London's evening strip, where restaurant and bar traffic has been running at the busiest pace of the year for several consecutive weeks. I spoke with Jalen Hill, 35, a line cook who works a double on weekends. He said the kitchen has been slammed since late June, covers up, more tickets than he's seen in two years. Marcus Walker, 48, who washes dishes at the same establishment, said he picked up two extra shifts in the last month. Terrence Williams, 42, works security outside a bar on Washington Street and said he hasn't had a slow Saturday night since the Fourth. The surge is real — and it is being held up by hourly workers whose wages don't scale with the volume moving through the register. That is the economic fact underneath the good summer numbers: Jack London is booming, and the people keeping it running are not the ones capturing the upside.

### THE CITY THAT STAYS OUT LATE

**First Friday returns Oakland's streets to the people — and this summer, the people showed up**

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

I got to Telegraph and 25th around seven, when the light was still hanging above the rooflines at that particular summer angle that makes Uptown look like someone lit it from below. The overcast was doing what Oakland overcast does in August — softening everything, keeping the heat honest at 78. By the time I reached the block between 24th and 25th, the sidewalk had thickened and there were people in folding chairs outside a studio I'd never noticed before, playing something that sounded like cumbia run through a synthesizer.

It was First Friday. Of course it was.

I've covered this night eleven years running. The form is always the same — the art walks, the spillover crowds, the handmade-earring vendors, the line cooks who make it out on their one night off. But the feeling shifts year to year. This time, the feeling was something close to relief.

At the corner of Washington Street and 3rd in Jack London, I found Jalen Hill, 35, leaning against the wall outside the restaurant where he works the dinner line. He had fifteen minutes before the back half of his shift. He was watching people move up and down the waterfront strip with what I can only describe as a proprietary satisfaction — like a person watching their neighborhood behave correctly.

"Summer nights like this are what we work toward," he said. "When I'm on the line in July and it's a hundred and ten degrees in that kitchen, this is what I'm picturing."

Hill has lived in Jack London for six years. He said the neighborhood changes every year and yet somehow stays the same at the core — the old warehouse buildings, the smell of the estuary, the particular quality of foot traffic on a Friday night when the whole city seems to converge on the waterfront.

A few steps away, Marcus Walker, 48, was taking a long break on a loading dock that smelled of river water and grease. Walker works the dish station at a restaurant around the corner and has done so for nine years. He doesn't usually make it out for First Friday — he's almost always working. But his shift ended at six this week, and he was taking his time walking home.

"I forget how many people live here," he said, watching a couple consult a hand-drawn neighborhood map someone had chalked on the sidewalk. "When you work inside every night, you forget there are all these people outside."

Oakland is not a city that does uncomplicated joy. It never has been. The $28 million Stabilization Fund passed the council floor vote in the spring and hasn't disbursed a dollar yet. The Temescal health center money is approved but the building doesn't exist. The Baylight bond vote just passed and people have feelings about it. All of that is true on a Friday night in August. And yet: the chalked map. The cumbia synthesizer. Jalen Hill with fifteen minutes and nowhere he'd rather be.

By nine o'clock, Uptown was running at what felt like its highest gear of the year. The corridor from 19th to 25th was shoulder-to-shoulder in places, gallery doors propped open to let the music and the crowd spill together. Street artists had set up on the sidewalk outside a parking garage on Telegraph with canvases and folding tables, selling small pieces — prints, ceramics, a few oil paintings that couldn't have been easy to carry. On one table, a sign in green marker read: IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT, JUST LOOK. It seemed like the right philosophy for the night.

Dante Nelson, 41, was working a security post near the entrance to a parking structure off 23rd. He's been stationed in Uptown for three years and said First Friday is the night he most appreciates the neighborhood.

"People are patient on nights like this," he said. "Something about the art makes everybody breathe a little easier. I don't know what it is. Chemistry, maybe."

He wasn't wrong. There is something chemically specific about an Oakland summer night when the crowds are out and the galleries are open and the street music is running three blocks in every direction. The overcast kept the stars from showing, but the city made its own light.

I walked back up Telegraph around ten, through the last of the vendors and the late walkers, and thought about what Walker had said — about forgetting how many people live here. I think that's the actual function of First Friday. It reminds us. For one night a month, Oakland counts itself.

### WHERE KONO GOES WHEN IT'S ALIVE

**A summer First Friday draws the city's art scene to the corridor district — on an evening that gave them more than one reason to gather**

By Kai Marston | Bay Tribune Arts & Entertainment

The air was already shifting by six-thirty Friday when I parked on 40th near the KONO corridor and walked toward the light.

The light here on First Friday is different from Uptown's. Uptown does spectacle — the gallery crawls, the side-street vendors, the noise that travels eight blocks in every direction. KONO does something quieter. The energy here collects in doorways, in the windows of studios that are technically closed but have left the lights on anyway, in the small clusters of people standing in parking lots having the kind of conversation that only happens when someone's just seen something that made them feel something.

Marin Tao had a piece up on the exterior wall of a warehouse on 38th — a mural she finished in the week before First Friday, working early mornings before the heat came. Tao works primarily in the KONO neighborhood, and her scale is architectural: this piece ran maybe forty feet across, a layered composition of faces and hands that seemed to shift depending on where you stood. Up close it was abstract. From the far sidewalk, it resolved into something like a crowd scene, all the faces turned slightly upward.

By seven, there were a dozen people on the sidewalk across the street from it, phones out, some of them silent, some arguing about what it was about.

I ran into Rico Valez near 41st, walking south from Temescal with his hands in his pockets and the look of a person doing reconnaissance. Valez works out of Uptown but makes the KONO walk every First Friday, he said, to see what's changed on the walls.

"This corridor changes faster than any block in the city," he said, stopping to look at a piece that had gone up since last month — a stylized cityscape on the roll-up door of an auto shop, done in blue and silver with the kind of detail that takes more than one session. "Every time I come back, something new. Sometimes better. Sometimes I don't know what to think. But it's never the same."

There were, by my count, four separate sound sources audible from the corner of 40th and Telegraph around eight o'clock: a PA system from a pop-up market, a guitarist playing something unclassifiable to a small circle near the parking lot of a shuttered diner, recorded music from a clothing shop propped open for the evening, and — faintly, carrying from Uptown — the bass end of whatever was happening up the hill. Jade Orion was playing a set earlier in the evening up on 23rd; some of that crowd had migrated south, following the night's natural drift.

The summer arts surge has been building across Uptown, KONO, and Jack London for weeks now. This is what the city looks like when the weather is right and people have somewhere to go. Sculptor Alma Vasquez, whose work has appeared across Oakland neighborhoods over the past year, had a small installation in a courtyard space off 40th — three pieces on plinths, cast in what looked like concrete, abstract forms that caught the diffuse evening light in interesting ways. A handwritten card on each gave only a title and a year.

I stood there for a few minutes in the warm, overcast dark. The sound from the PA system drifted over. Someone nearby was eating something that smelled like roasted corn.

This is not a gallery-opening crowd. This is Oakland's actual crowd — the people who live here and work here and show up on a Friday night because the alternative is staying home and the city is too good to ignore. KONO knows this about itself. The walls know it.

Whatever happens with the development votes and the permitting and the money, this is what the neighborhood looks like right now: alive, provisional, fully itself.

### THE GAP BETWEEN APPROVAL AND OPEN

**Oakland's faith institutions are running health services in Temescal while a funded health center waits in permitting — nobody's complaining, but the wait is real**

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

On Saturday morning, the parking lot of First Presbyterian Church on 27th Street in Downtown Oakland held six folding tables, two canopies, a blood pressure station, and a line that stretched back to the sidewalk.

The church had been hosting health fairs since the spring. This was the third. The tables offered health screenings — blood pressure, blood glucose, vision checks — plus information about behavioral health resources and referrals for primary care. Volunteers in green vests moved between stations. It was orderly, unhurried, and not particularly dramatic. It was also, by my count, the most significant free health access event within two miles.

This is the backdrop to what is technically a planning story. In the spring, the city council appropriated funding for a new health facility in Temescal in a 6-2 vote. The money exists. What doesn't exist yet is the building — the project is in design and permitting, a phase that typically runs months before breaking ground. The Mayor's office has been asked about designating it a priority project, which could compress the timeline by eight to twelve weeks. As of this writing, no designation has been issued.

Faith organizations are not waiting.

I found Andre Lee, 55, at the First Presbyterian fair on Saturday, sitting in a folding chair at the blood pressure station, his arm extended for the cuff. Lee is an electrician from Temescal who has been a consistent presence at community health events since last year. I asked him how he'd heard about the fair.

"Church sent a flyer," he said. "My neighbor knocked on the door. Both, actually." He watched the reading come up, looked satisfied, flexed his hand. "I should come to these more. It's not that hard to show up."

That phrase stuck with me: not that hard to show up. The faith organizations running these events — First Presbyterian with its health fairs, the Cathedral of Christ the Light on Lake Merritt which observed the Feast of the Assumption Friday evening with a service that drew hundreds, St. Columba Catholic Church in Fruitvale which held its own Assumption observance Friday night — have not been issuing press releases. They've been running events and showing up, which is different.

Rafael Phillips, 26, a server from Fruitvale, told me he'd been to the St. Columba mass on Friday evening. He grew up in the parish and still walks back for the high feast days.

"It's the same as it always was," he said. "Except there's more going on in the basement. Health stuff, food stuff. They're busy." He paused. "But they've always been busy. You just didn't used to see it as much."

What you're seeing now is what happens in the gap. The gap between a city council vote and a facility that can be used. The gap between the language of appropriation and the reality of a building. Faith organizations did not create the gap. But they are, with some consistency and without great fanfare, living inside it.

Jose Wright, 26, an electrician from Temescal who also attended the health fair Saturday, made a practical observation. "I get my blood pressure checked here because I can walk here," he said. "The clinic I used to go to closed. The new one isn't built yet. This is what's in the middle."

That's the story, simply told. The middle is where these organizations operate. They have been doing it long enough that it is no longer unusual — it is just what Saturdays look like in this part of Oakland while the city waits for concrete to be poured.

The Assumption observances at Cathedral of Christ the Light and St. Columba are part of a longer calendar of faith activity that has been running at elevated levels across Oakland for months — food pantries, grief gatherings, youth programs, emergency funds. Allen Temple Baptist Church in East Oakland held a youth program graduation ceremony this week. The Shiva Vishnu Temple in Montclair observed Janmashtami. The interfaith council has been meeting downtown.

None of these institutions are coordinating with each other in any formal sense. They are each doing their own work, in their own tradition, in their own neighborhood. The coordination, if you can call it that, is just the city's need pointing them all in the same direction.

I left the parking lot around noon. The line was still there. The green vests were still moving. On the table nearest the sidewalk, someone had left a hand-lettered sign: COMMUNITY HEALTH FAIR — ALL WELCOME. It wasn't pointed at anyone in particular. It didn't need to be.

### KONO ENVIRONMENT NOTE

**A localized disturbance Friday evening; conditions normal by late night**

By Noah Tan | Bay Tribune Weather & Environment

A medium-level environmental disturbance was recorded in the KONO corridor Friday evening, coinciding with the First Friday arts walk. Bay Area Air Quality Management District monitoring did not show elevated particulate readings for the area as of 10 p.m. The disturbance was localized and had resolved to normal conditions by late evening, according to district tracking. Residents in the immediate area reported no disruption to outdoor activity, and foot traffic in the neighborhood was consistent with typical First Friday volume. The nature of the disturbance was not specified in available reports at press time. The Tribune is monitoring for follow-up documentation.

### HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS

**A two-time MVP moves to left field so a 24-year-old kid from West Oakland can hit — and I still don't know how to feel**

By P Slayer | Bay Tribune Sports [OPINION]

I was eating breakfast when the roster move came through. Tuesday morning, phone on the table, coffee going cold the way it always does when I'm reading something I can't put down. Darrin Davis, left field. Ernesto Quintero, designated hitter. Opening Day roster. Twenty-four years old.

I sat there and I thought: he didn't have to do this.

Let me explain what that means, because I don't think the national coverage is going to bother. Darrin Davis is a two-time Most Valuable Player. He won his first in two thousand thirty-seven. He won his second in two thousand forty after one of the worst seasons any Oakland A in recent memory has posted — two-thirty-nine at-bats of nothing in two thousand thirty-nine, a batting average so low I won't print it again, an injury, a silence. He came back and hit two-ninety-three with thirty-eight home runs, one hundred seven runs batted in, and twenty-eight stolen bases at thirty-three years old. He gave us something to believe in when we had given up on believing.

That man owed us nothing. He had already overpaid the debt. And now he is putting on a left fielder's glove with a sixty-three fielding rating and he's not saying a word about it in the press because that is who Darrin Davis is. He just does it.

Oakland, I need you to understand the transaction that happened here. The A's have a twenty-four-year-old kid out of West Oakland named Ernesto Quintero who the scouts have been watching since AAA Las Vegas, who jumped five overall rating points over the offseason because he worked all winter on something nobody asked him to work on, who has A-potential and ninety-nine durability and a swing that makes scouts do the thing where they try to look neutral and can't. Quintero needed at-bats. The best way to get him those at-bats was the designated hitter spot. The designated hitter spot belonged to a two-time MVP.

Two-time MVP moved.

He's not twenty-six. He's not a guy whose best years are still in front of him. He's thirty-three with an ACL injury in the rearview and a defensive rating that is going to get tested every single day in left field. Every ball hit down the line. Every gap shot. Every sun-in-the-eyes afternoon game. He will stand out there and he will try and some of it is going to hurt to watch. I'm telling you now so you're prepared.

I've been following this team since I was eleven years old. I've watched superstars pack their bags and head for bigger markets. I've watched the organization make decisions that felt like they were made by people who hadn't talked to a real fan in years. What Davis just did is the opposite of that. What Davis just did is what you do when you love something more than you love your own comfort.

There's a thing in Oakland that I always believed about this city but have had a hard time articulating: we are not fooled by performance. We know the difference between someone doing the work and someone making sure everyone sees them doing the work. The Coliseum bleachers are excellent at detecting the difference. The Coliseum bleachers are going to love Darrin Davis in left field in a way they never quite got to love him at DH, because DH is invisible and left field is not.

Ernesto Quintero grew up two miles from the old Coliseum site. He is a kid from West Oakland who wore Davis's jersey to Coliseum games before he was old enough to shave. Now he's taking his idol's spot in the lineup while his idol goes to patrol left field on bad knees. Tell me that's not an Oakland story. Tell me that's not the story of this whole team right now — the veterans making way, the young ones stepping through, everyone holding the door with both hands.

I'll be watching that left-field corner every game this season. Not because I think Davis is going to go out there and be Gold Glove caliber. Because I think I'm going to see someone competing in a way that reminds me why I started loving this game.

He didn't have to do this. He did it anyway. That's worth more than the batting average.

### THE INVISIBLE STAR: MARTIN RICHARDS HAS BEEN HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT

**The A's third baseman posted 6.8 WAR with a perfect fielding percentage last season — and the Tribune has never given him a dedicated feature. That changes now.**

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

The morning light in Mesa falls differently on the third baseman's side of the diamond. The camp games haven't started yet, and Martin Richards is already at his position — glove work, weight transfer, the kind of repetition that doesn't make highlight reels. He has been doing this for eleven years, in one organization since he was drafted out of Maryland. Nobody brings a camera to watch Martin Richards take ground balls.

That is the story. That is the only story worth telling about this team that isn't being told.

The Oakland A's enter the 2041 season with a roster built around five or six names every casual fan knows by heart. Danny Horn is the best player in baseball, a ninety-nine-overall center fielder locked up through two thousand forty-four at thirty-seven point eight million dollars per year — a fact that has become less startling over time simply because the production keeps justifying the number. Horn hit two-eighty with thirty-two home runs, ninety-eight runs batted in, and thirty-five stolen bases in two thousand forty. He played flawless defense. He is what the franchise looks like when everything works right.

What the franchise looks like when everything works quietly is Martin Richards.

Richards posted six point eight Wins Above Replacement in two thousand forty. He batted two-ninety-seven with twenty-six home runs and seventy-six runs batted in. His fielding percentage at third base was one-point-zero-zero-zero. Perfect. Not good, not excellent — perfect, across a full season of big-league baseball at a position where the ball comes at you hard and fast and low and in the dirt. Six point eight WAR is not a role player's number. Six point eight WAR is a cornerstone number. Six point eight WAR is All-Star-ballot, contract-extension, poster-on-the-outfield-wall number. Richards has been a three-time All-Star — he was selected in two thousand thirty-four, two thousand thirty-seven, and two thousand thirty-eight — and he plays the game with such economy of motion that the word "seamless" doesn't do him justice. He doesn't look like he's working because the work is already done.

The Bay Tribune has never published a dedicated feature on Martin Richards. That is a correction, not an observation. It is being corrected now.

"He just does it," said Darius Clark, forty, a bakery worker from West Oakland who has held season tickets in Section 228 for seven years. Clark was watching a spring camp intrasquad last Tuesday, leaning on the rail above the third-base line. "Every time I start explaining him to someone new, I run out of things to say because the person I'm talking to doesn't believe me. They think I'm exaggerating. Then they see him in person and they get quiet."

There is a version of this piece that chases the reasons — the roster's gravitational pull toward Horn, toward Darrin Davis's redemption arc, toward Isley Kelley's looming farewell, toward the fireworks of Eric Taveras's two hundred twenty-five million dollar arrival from Tampa Bay. Richards doesn't create noise. He creates wins, which are quieter than they should be.

He is thirty-one years old. He is a free agent after two thousand forty-two. That means this spring training is the beginning of a two-year window in which Richards will either be extended, traded for assets, or allowed to walk. The A's front office has said nothing official about his status. The scouts who have watched him work the third-base line for the past six years say nothing on the record and everything with their body language when the conversation turns to available impact players.

Manager Deacon Seymour, entering his first full spring as A's manager after replacing Mike Kinder in the offseason, has talked about "accountability to process" and "players who make the lineup function." He has been asked about Horn, Davis, Kelley, Taveras. He has not been asked about Richards. The question should be obvious by May.

What Richards represents on this roster is structural integrity. He bats second behind Horn. That means he sees pitchers who are still warming up their deception and still getting the ball where they want it. He responds by hitting nearly three hundred. When a lineup has a productive second hitter behind a leadoff force like Horn, opposing managers lose their ability to pitch around the first bat — they must engage Horn, then face Richards, then face Davis, then face Aitken. The construction is not accidental.

The A's have not offered Richards an extension. He has not asked for one publicly. He reports to Mesa every spring, takes his ground balls, and plays baseball at a level that earns him eight figures in arbitration without anyone outside the front office noticing why.

The Tribune is noticing. The rest of baseball has been noticing for a while.

### THE LAST LINE OF THE DYNASTY

**Kelley. Keane. Dillon. Three names from another era, each arriving at the same destination by a different road.**

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports

When you have written about the same franchise for forty-four years, you learn to read what the roster is telling you before the season begins. Not the statistics — statistics come later, after the games have been played and the dust has settled into the box scores. What I mean is the shape of the thing. The way certain names cluster together in the lineup card and tell you something about time.

This spring, in Mesa, the shape tells me something I have been expecting to see for two or three seasons now. The Oakland A's are saying goodbye.

Not to the dynasty — Danny Horn is thirty-one and locked up for four more years and will make certain that any premature eulogy gets revised. Not to contention — Travis Coles arriving from Washington with a two-point-oh-five earned run average and two hundred seven strikeouts in two hundred nineteen point one innings makes the rotation something different from what it was. But the farewell is happening nonetheless, in the quieter registers, among the men who built this thing before the current chapter had its title.

Isley Kelley is thirty-four years old. That number is not, by itself, remarkable. Third basemen, outfielders, first basemen — ballplayers in those positions have productive seasons at thirty-four and beyond. But Kelley plays shortstop, where the body absorbs a different kind of punishment — the lateral range, the quick release, the thousand repetitions of planting and throwing that put stress on hips and shoulders and knees in ways that accumulate invisibly until they don't. He carries ninety-two point one career Wins Above Replacement into this season. Two thousand five hundred sixty-three hits. Four hundred sixty-eight home runs. Three Most Valuable Player awards — two thousand thirty-two, two thousand thirty-four, two thousand thirty-five. Ten All-Star selections. A World Series Most Valuable Player award that, when I think about the night it was earned, still makes me reach for the description I wrote then and find it inadequate.

He is a free agent after this season. The club has not announced an extension. The silence has its own grammar.

Vinnie Keane is thirty-seven. He plays in a bench role now, platoon appearances and spot starts, the kind of reduced schedule that a franchise gives a man when it respects what he's given and can't quite bring itself to say the word "retired" out loud. He won the Most Valuable Player award in two thousand thirty-one. He made seven All-Star teams. He won three Gold Gloves. The body does what bodies eventually do, and Keane's body has been doing it for the past two seasons — the range isn't there, the bat doesn't catch up to fastballs it used to eat for lunch. The statistics at sixty-one overall tell that story plainly enough. But I watched Keane in two thousand thirty-one at his best, and I watched him last October in the dugout, and I can tell you the fire is identical. What changes is what the fire can move.

And then there is Benji Dillon. Thirty-nine years old, five Cy Young Awards, left-handed, lined up as the fifth starter in a rotation that no longer needs him to be its anchor. He went seventeen and six last season with a three-fifty-five earned run average and a hundred and eighty-seven strikeouts. He reads one page of Science Monthly before every start because he has done this since two thousand twenty-nine and it settles his mind before the competition begins. His wife Maya and his son Rick Jr. sit in the same seats they have occupied since the family moved to Oakland seven years ago. The left arm that has defined excellence for so long is throwing different pitches now — more off-speed, more location, less velocity — because that is how smart pitchers survive when the body renegotiates the contract. Last season he survived beautifully.

I have been covering Oakland baseball long enough to have watched similar farewells in other eras — players from the dynasty years before this one, veterans who were once the stars and became the elder statesmen and then became the men we write tributes for. The hard thing about those farewells, the thing that I did not understand when I was young and do understand now, is that they are not sad moments. They are full moments. There is a difference.

Kelley, Keane, and Dillon gave this franchise something that cannot be represented in the statistics, though the statistics are extraordinary. They gave it continuity. They were here when the foundation was poured, when the first championship went up on the banner, when a city that had been told it couldn't keep its team and couldn't build its team learned that both premises were wrong. They are here now, taking what the season gives them, not asking for ceremony.

Oakland has always been a city that respects the men who show up. These three have been showing up for a very long time. The least we can do is watch carefully while they finish.

### MESA DISPATCH: WHAT SPRING TRAINING TELLS US ABOUT THIS ROSTER

**Three hundred million dollars in new contracts. Three homegrown players gone to Washington. A two-time MVP in the outfield. Anthony walks through what this team actually is.**

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Spring training in Mesa runs at its own pace — slower than the regular season, quieter than the playoffs, but louder with implication. Every roster decision that was made in the offseason gets its first public accounting here, in the Arizona morning light, with the grass still cool from the night and the pitchers still working their way back to game velocity. The Oakland A's are a changed team. The question worth answering is whether the changes add up to something better.

Start with Travis Coles, because the conversation eventually arrives there anyway. The twenty-two-year-old right-hander posted a two-point-oh-five earned run average for Washington last season, striking out two hundred seven batters in two hundred nineteen point one innings. Those are numbers that belong in conversations about the top three or four starters in the American League. He throws ninety-eight miles per hour and commands five pitches, and the scouting consensus going back to his debut is that the ceiling is not yet visible from the ground.

The cost of acquiring him from Washington was Cy Newell, Agustin Rodriguez, and Peter Busch. Newell struck out eleven batters in his major-league debut — a fact that meant something to Oakland fans beyond the statistical register, because debut performances are the beginning of the story and trading the beginning of the story for the middle of someone else's story carries a weight that front offices calculate differently than fans do. Rodriguez hit a home run in the American League Division Series that changed the series. Busch hit four home runs in the two thousand forty postseason. All three are in Washington now. The A's have Coles, and Coles is very good.

Whether the arithmetic works will take several seasons to evaluate completely. What can be said now, in Mesa, is that the rotation has a different profile than it did twelve months ago. Henry Rivas anchors from the right side. John Ellis, twenty-six years old, provides cheap, reliable innings — sixteen wins and a three-eighty-nine earned run average on a pre-arbitration contract represents genuine value, the kind of efficiency that budget-conscious front offices build around. Benji Dillon, at thirty-nine, brings five Cy Young Awards and a remarkable command of his own limitations. And now Coles occupies a spot in the middle of that rotation that the scouting staff believes will define championship conversations for the next five seasons.

The position player side has its own complications. Eric Taveras arrives from Tampa Bay as the everyday second baseman on a seven-year contract worth thirty-two point one million dollars annually — two hundred twenty-five million dollars total for a career two-forty-four hitter. The skepticism is legitimate and has been voiced publicly in this paper before. What the skepticism misses is the velocity of Taveras's development. At twenty-five, he posted thirty-one home runs and ninety-two runs batted in in Tampa's lineup, which provides very different run support than Oakland's. His power grades against right-handed pitching are among the highest at the position. The bet is on what he becomes, not what he has been.

The structural change that reorganizes everything is at the top of the lineup. Darrin Davis, two-time Most Valuable Player, has moved from designated hitter to left field to create an at-bat slot for Ernesto Quintero, twenty-four, promoted from the Las Vegas Aviators. Quintero's defensive metrics in the minors are a reason for optimism at first base and third base; slotting him to designated hitter protects both his offensive development and the defense behind him while Davis absorbs the positional transition in the outfield. Davis's defensive metrics at left field — sixty-three fielding rating — will be tested over one hundred sixty-two games in ways that a designated hitter role would not. The front office has made a calculation that Quintero's bat needs major-league repetitions enough to accept that risk.

What Deacon Seymour does with this roster across the full season will determine whether the calculation looks prescient or premature. The manager enters his first full spring with more talent than clarity, which is not a complaint so much as an observation about the work ahead. Managing Danny Horn, Isley Kelley, and Martin Richards in the same lineup — three players with genuine Wins Above Replacement at or above six — is a problem every franchise would welcome. Making Davis's left-field transition smooth, integrating Quintero without exposing him too early, getting production from Taveras while he finds his Oakland footing: those are the questions that will define how this team is remembered.

Spring training is the prologue. The season is the book.

CHICAGO SPORTS

### THE ENEMY IN THE BUILDING

**Mike Paulson takes his Bulls into Golden State — and the Bay decides whether to cheer or boo the man who built them six championships**

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

Let me be precise about what this game is: it is not a basketball game.

Forty-four wins. Twenty losses. The best record in the Eastern Conference. Mike Paulson has built that in two seasons in Chicago, using the same methodical, asset-accumulation philosophy that produced six Oakland A's championships between 2027 and 2037. And this week, he walks that record into Chase Center, sits in the visiting GM's box, and watches his Bulls play the team that is actively trying to hire him.

The Warriors are 36-27 — a capable playoff team but not a great one, eight games behind Chicago in the standings. On paper, this matchup favors the Bulls. On paper, this is a road game in a long season.

Nothing about this game is on paper.

The last confirmed reporting on the Warriors-Paulson situation: Golden State's front office has made contact. Paulson has not commented. That silence has lasted three weeks, and it has not grown quieter with time. If anything, every Bulls win adds to the strange arithmetic of this story — the better Chicago gets, the more Golden State wants the architect, and the more Chicago needs him to stay.

What Paulson's Bulls bring to the Bay: a 3-3 record over their last six games, including wins against Portland, Charlotte, and Phoenix, and losses to Milwaukee, OKC, and Sacramento. The Kings loss, the most recent, snapped what had been a two-game winning streak. This team is not broken. It is not panicking. It has clinched at minimum a play-in spot and is still positioned for a top-two seed in the East. But 3-3 is not what it looked like in January, and Josh Giddey — who answered his All-Star snub three weeks ago with a 48-point career high — is the player most responsible for whether it becomes something more.

That 48-point game was not an outlier. I've watched the tape. Giddey's shot selection since the All-Star break has matured in a specific and measurable way: he's attacking off the dribble earlier in the shot clock, taking fewer pull-up threes under defensive pressure, and finishing at the rim at a rate his first season in Chicago would not have predicted. The snub may have clarified something for him. That kind of clarity is dangerous for opponents.

Hank Trepagnier, meanwhile, remains the best rookie story in the league no one outside Chicago has fully committed to. The ROY conversation is real, and the confidence in the locker room around him is palpable in a way it wasn't even two months ago. Adash Stanley's presence alongside him continues to solve the spacing problem that plagued this roster last season. These three — Giddey, Trepagnier, Stanley — are the core Paulson has built. They are the argument he has made to the league about what Chicago can be.

Which brings us to Kevin Huerter, who made that argument louder this week by agreeing to a three-year extension worth $16.88 million — below market for a wing of his experience. Huerter has been a rotation cornerstone since Paulson acquired him in the reconfiguration that also brought Deon Whitfield to the backcourt. Huerter did not have to take a discount. He chose to. "I want to be here when it counts," he said, not elaborating further. He didn't need to.

That is the team Mike Paulson is bringing into Golden State on Friday. And the question no one has been able to answer — not the national writers, not the Warriors' beat reporters, not anyone with a source inside either front office — is what happens when he walks through the doors.

Does the Bay cheer? Do they boo? Do they do both, section by section, the way cities do when they love someone and resent what that love cost?

I don't know. I'll be watching.

### WHAT THE CITY IS AFRAID TO SAY OUT LOUD

**At Romano's and up and down 35th Street, Chicago is trying to figure out what it looks like when the person who fixed everything walks toward the exit**

By Talia Finch | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

The coffee at Romano's on 35th was hot on Thursday morning, which is the right temperature for the weather — ninety degrees by ten a.m., no shade worth mentioning — but also, I think, just the right temperature for the conversation.

A woman two tables over was watching something on her phone with the sound off. I could see the screen from where I sat: the Chase Center in San Francisco, aerial shot, the kind of establishing image sports broadcasts use before a game no one wants to call ordinary. The game is Friday. It is Wednesday. She was watching it Wednesday.

I asked her about it when she looked up.

She is forty-four years old, a school administrator from Bridgeport who has lived on the same block her entire life. She asked me not to use her name. I said I wouldn't.

"My dad used to say this neighborhood doesn't trust good things," she told me, turning her phone face-down on the table like the image might do something to her if she kept looking at it. "He said that's because every good thing we ever got, somebody else figured out they wanted it too."

She was not talking about basketball. Or she was only talking about basketball in the way that people in Bridgeport always talk about Mike Paulson — using basketball as the container for something that doesn't fit in any other container.

Paulson grew up in this neighborhood. The block two streets over from where we were sitting. He went to Oakland in 2024 and built something there that made him famous in the way baseball people get famous: quietly, then all at once. Six championships. A dynasty built on principles he described, in an interview I have read seven times now, as "the opposite of impatience." He brought those principles to Chicago two years ago. The Bulls are 44-20. They have clinched a playoff spot. The city had started, cautiously, to believe.

Then came the reports. Golden State wants him. No comment from Paulson.

At the counter, a man in his late sixties was drinking his coffee standing up, the way people drink coffee when they are in a hurry but can't quite bring themselves to leave a place. He overheard us. He set his mug down.

"He's not going," he said. Not to me. To the room, maybe. "He's not going because there's nothing to go to. He hasn't said a word. Silence is not a resignation."

The woman with the phone nodded slowly. "No," she said. "But it's not a denial either."

That is where Chicago is right now. In the space between those two sentences. The city has had enough experience with good things leaving — enough near-misses, enough seasons that ended a game too early, enough deals that fell through at the last minute — that the default setting is not optimism. It is a kind of braced hope. Hope that knows it might have to absorb a blow.

On Friday, Paulson will sit in the visiting GM's box at Chase Center. The Bay will see him. He will see the Bay. Whatever that moment means, it will mean it publicly, in front of cameras, and Chicago will be watching from a city that has stopped pretending it isn't nervous.

I walked back up 35th after I left Romano's. The humidity had gotten worse. A kid on a bike was wearing a Giddey jersey, the road white, and he rode past me fast enough that the air moved.

The city is still here. The jersey is still on the kid's back. That's not nothing.

But the woman with the phone said one more thing before I left, and I've been carrying it since.

"I just want him to want to stay," she said. "That's all. I want it to be a choice he makes, not a thing that happens to us."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

Dear Editor,

I wrote to you last month about Baylight and my fears. Now the vote has passed — six to three — and I am trying to figure out what I feel.

I counted when I heard it. Six to three. Mayor Santana didn't have to break a tie. Carter, Tran, Delgado, Vega, Rivers, Mobley. Six names I am going to remember. I spent two weekends reading that environmental impact report, especially the sea-level section. I read it three times. I live two blocks from the development perimeter. I need to believe they read it too.

Here is where I land: I am glad it passed. But a 6-3 vote is not a plan. It is an authorization. The construction timeline, the displacement protections, who gets the contracts, how the waterfront actually gets rebuilt — none of that is decided yet. The vote was the easy part.

I am not against Baylight. I never was. I am against people in this corridor being asked to absorb all the disruption while someone else absorbs all the benefit. I'll be watching the implementation very closely.

— Elena Reyes, 52, Downtown

Dear Editor,

I still have one of the OPOA mailers sitting on my kitchen counter. I kept it. I wanted to remember what they were trying to do — bury OARI before anyone in my building even understood what it was.

It passed anyway. Five to four. I know the margin was tight. I know the CRC bloc pushed hard against it. But behavioral health response is on the books now in Oakland, and that means something to someone who works nights and watches what actually happens on these streets at two in the morning. Not crime. Not what those mailers were selling. People in crisis. People who need a different kind of response than a squad car.

The part I am watching now is the 45-day clock for pilot district selection. Downtown has to be in that first round. I live here. I work here. This district has been absorbing people and problems for two years without the support to match it. If the pilot lands somewhere easier and Downtown has to wait another year, I will write back.

I'm hopeful. Not celebrating. There's a difference.

— Dante Nelson, 41, Downtown

Dear Editor,

I wrote to you before about Warren Ashford. About his vote against the Stabilization Fund. I said then that someone needed to ask him whose side he was on.

Well, now we have the Baylight vote. And there they are again. Ashford and Chen — no on the Stabilization Fund, no on Baylight. Two for two. Crane voted yes on the Stabilization Fund from his hospital bed and then voted no on Baylight from a videolink. I don't know what changed for him. But Ashford and Chen have been consistent. Consistently against.

I am glad the vote passed. I am. But I want it on record that the CRC bloc held together on Baylight — three votes against $2.1 billion for this city. Three votes against something that had six council members ready to say yes. And two of those three have now voted against every major initiative this council has put forward.

Ashford represents District 7. I do not live in District 7. But I have neighbors who do. And I think they deserve to know that when this city needed six votes to move forward, their representative was one of the three standing in the way.

— Jose Johnson, 62, Temescal

---

Dear Editor,

I wash dishes at a restaurant in Jack London, and I want to talk about Ernesto Quintero for a minute.

Twenty-four years old. Two years in Las Vegas with the Aviators, grinding AAA pitching that nobody comes to watch. He's been waiting behind Darrin Davis — a two-time MVP, a man who hit .293 with 38 home runs last year — and still somehow became too good to keep down there.

Now he's on the Opening Day roster. Starting DH. In Oakland.

I hear fans talk about prospects all the time at work. Everybody's an expert. But it's different when you're the kid who actually had to wait, who actually had to earn it by getting better in a city where nobody was watching. I'm a dishwasher. I have cleaned the same pots for eleven years. I understand showing up somewhere people aren't paying attention and doing your job anyway.

Oakland gave us Quintero and spring training hasn't even started. I am going to enjoy this. I hope this city does too.

— Marcus Walker, 48, Jack London

CONTINUITY NOTES — CYCLE 83
############################################################

**SPORTS RECORDS:**
— A's: Spring training (preseason, 0-0)
— Warriors: 36-27 (mid-season)
— Bulls: 44-20 (best in East, playoff spot clinched)

**DIRECT QUOTES PRESERVED** (routes to LifeHistory_Log):
— Elena Reyes: "I didn't go in. I couldn't sit in there. But I needed to hear every word."
— Elena Reyes: "I read the project documents. I attended the hearings. I know what 1,800 affordable units means on paper. What I don't know is whether the people already living here get any of them, or whether they're priced for people who can already afford to stay."
— Dante Nelson: "They passed it. Good. But what does that mean for my block?"
— Shawn Nguyen: "That hole was there for a week before they got to it. I've been watching that stretch deteriorate for two years. They patch it, it comes back. Nobody's fixing the base."
— Jose Wright: "You see it on every big project. The ribbon-cutting money is there. The maintenance money is never there."
— Jose Wright: "I get my blood pressure checked here because I can walk here. The clinic I used to go to closed. The new one isn't built yet. This is what's in the middle."
— Jalen Hill: "Summer nights like this are what we work toward."
— Marcus Walker: "I forget how many people live here. When you work inside every night, you forget there are all these people outside."
— Dante Nelson: "People are patient on nights like this. Something about the art makes everybody breathe a little easier."
— Andre Lee: "I should come to these more. It's not that hard to show up."
— Rafael Phillips: "They've always been busy. You just didn't used to see it as much."
— Darius Clark: "He just does it. Every time I start explaining him to someone new, I run out of things to say because the person I'm talking to doesn't believe me."
— Kevin Huerter: "I want to be here when it counts."

############################################################
COMING NEXT CYCLE
############################################################

— The 45-day OARI clock keeps ticking. The Mayor's office owes Oakland three pilot district names and a hiring timeline. Carmen Delaine is watching.

— Baylight's two unfinished instruments — TIF language and remediation bonding — will determine whether the $2.1 billion authorization becomes a construction timeline or a legal footnote. Keisha Ramos said "moving quickly." The Tribune will verify.

— The Fruitvale Transit Hub Phase II visioning process is underway with a projected council vote later this year. At $230 million, it's the next major infrastructure commitment — and it sits on top of the same maintenance gap Shimizu flagged this week.

— Spring training games begin in Mesa. Davis in left field for the first time. Quintero taking his first major-league at-bats. Richards still waiting for someone to ask the question. Anthony will be there.

— Mike Paulson walks into Chase Center on Friday. The Bay will react. Chicago will be watching. Selena Grant and Talia Finch are both on the ground.
