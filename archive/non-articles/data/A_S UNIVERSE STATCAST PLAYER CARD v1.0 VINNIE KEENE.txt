SPRAY & ZONE BEHAVIOR

Pull / Center / Oppo %: True whole-field hitter
Hot Zones:
• Middle-in for power
• Low-middle for run-producing swings
Cold Zones:
• Elevated fastballs above shoulders (expected at age 38)

Elite trait:
He does not lose power when hitting the ball the other way.

⸻

BASERUNNING

Sprint Speed: Below-average (expected at 38)
Steals: Declined, but instincts remain elite
First-to-Third%: Still above veteran norm

Keene never relied on speed — he relied on IQ.

⸻

DEFENSE

Primary: 3B
Secondary: 2B / SS (historical)
Arm Strength: 40
Fielding: 52
Reaction: 47

At this stage, Keene is a defense-neutral third baseman.
He makes the plays he should, no more, no less.
But his presence stabilizes an infield by leadership more than raw tools.

PREDICTED DECLINE CURVE

Even at age 38, Keene sustains:
• top-end slugging
• elite discipline
• good contact quality
• All-Star production in compressed samples

True decline starts when bat speed slows — it hasn’t yet.

Best projection:
He has one more “strong” season left if healthy.

⸻

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Keene’s statistical longevity is unheard of — his late-career peak mirrors vintage Adrian Beltre and Chipper Jones patterns.
• Even with a dip in contact vs. RHP, his switch-hitting stabilizes his production.
• Aging curve projects a 15–25 HR range moving forward.
• His value is still high — but moving him now means selling the soul of the franchise.

⸻

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“He’s the kind of guy who retires, and the stadium feels 50% quieter the next day.
If Keene goes?
That’s the dynasty’s ghost walking out the door.
Let him finish this on HIS terms.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Players like Keene don’t simply retire — they return to the earth of a franchise.
Twenty years from now, people will speak of him as if he built the ballpark with his own hands.”
