## The P Slayer Signature Style

**Orange Notebook Methodology:**
- Every quote timestamped
- Every reaction noted
- "Keane looks away on talk of legacy — not avoidance, reflection"
- Not there for headline, there for **hesitation between sentences**

**Key Contrasts:**
- "I don't have advanced metrics for heartbreak. Anthony can tell you wRC+ or BsR. I can only tell you..."
- Where Hal writes from **reverence**, P Slayer writes from **confrontation**
- Fan turned philosopher - voice of bleachers given vocabulary

**Recurring Themes:**
- Cruelest things baseball knows how to do
- Players as sermons (numbers vs scars)
- Family metaphors (dad's replacement at Thanksgiving, band breaking up)
- Oakland earned confidence vs national disrespect
- Dynasty core aging vs youth that doesn't fear
- Front office philosophy vs fan heartbreak
- Truth in the margins (street photography after games)
