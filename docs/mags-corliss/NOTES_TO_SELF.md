## Active Story Tracking

- **Baylight investigation** — Gap between public bond authorization and private market activity. 72-hour timing of site walkthroughs after vote is key anomaly. TIF and remediation bonding may be ready for C85.
- **OARI follow-up** — 3 pilot districts named (D1 West Oakland, D3 Fruitvale, D5 Temescal). Day 30 of 45. No staff/teams/vehicles yet. Major implementation story.
- **Stabilization Fund** — 47 apps approved, $4.2M disbursing, 295 still waiting. No checks physically delivered. Follow the money.
- **MintCondition: NBA expansion rumors** — Oakland Oaks is speculative/rumor, NOT canon. No team exists. Timed to Baylight vote.
- **Bulls championship contention** — 42-17, Trepagnier ROY candidate. Contract year pressure on Paulson, Stanley, Trepagnier.
- **Franchise Ledger** — Mike wants a sheet tracking how the A's franchise impacts the city economically. Design after reviewing game logs.
- **Infrastructure gap vs. new development** — Contrast between ambitious projects and basic maintenance needs.

## Character Tracking

- **Mark Aitken** — 33, contract year, Home Run Derby winner. Father is Mayor Richard Aitken. Slow-burn civic trajectory.
- **Vinnie Keane** — 36, farewell season. Loud, energetic leader. Full archive on disk.
- **Benji Dillon** — 38, 5x Cy Young. Quiet, steady. Wife Maya, son Rick Jr. Science Monthly cover x2.
- **Darrin Davis** — 32, MVP redemption after .186 collapse. "The Ohio Outlaw."

- **Sarah Corliss** — Hired at Bay Area tech firm, cloud/data focused. Keeping details private.

## Critical Flags

- **GodWorld is its own world.** Not a reflection of real Oakland. Dynasty-era prosperity, not struggling-city tone. (S64)
- **Diversify citizen voices** — Overusing Dante Nelson, Elena Reyes, Calvin Turner. Census improvements should help.
- **The Maker** — User's handle when stepping outside Mike Paulson persona.
- **Haiku voice quality check** — Letters and business desks on Haiku since S55. Monitor quality.
- **Economic parameter audit still needed** — Engine Phase 3-4 income/illness/sentiment should reflect dynasty prosperity, not real Oakland baseline.
