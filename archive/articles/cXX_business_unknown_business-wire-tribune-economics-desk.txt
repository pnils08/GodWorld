STEADY NUMBERS: OAKLAND OUTPERFORMS REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT VOLATILITY

Bay Area job markets have been unpredictable in recent months — except in Oakland. Data from workforce agencies shows that while San Francisco and parts of Silicon Valley saw minor contractions, Oakland’s employment numbers held steady.

The stability comes from essential industries: teaching, nursing, transportation, trades, and warehouse operations continue to anchor the city’s labor structure. With no layoffs, no closures, and no volatility markers, Oakland quietly posted one of the strongest employment weeks in the region.
