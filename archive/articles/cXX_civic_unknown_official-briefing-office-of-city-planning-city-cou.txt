OFFICIAL BRIEFING — Office of City Planning
To: Carmen Delaine, Bay Tribune Civic Affairs
From: Mara Vance, City Planning Director
Cycle: 74
Subject: RE: City Council Vacancy Procedures
───────────────────────────────────────
Ms. Delaine,
Thank you for your inquiry. I’ll address each point directly.
1. Legal Mechanism
The Oakland City Charter provides two pathways for filling Council vacancies:
	∙	Mayoral Appointment: Mayor nominates a candidate, remaining seated Council members confirm by simple majority. Appointee serves until the next scheduled election for that seat.
	∙	Special Election: Called by Council resolution. Requires filing period, campaign window, and vote. Used when appointment fails or Council chooses this route.
Appointment is the faster mechanism and is standard practice for mid-term vacancies.
2. Timeline Requirements
The Charter requires vacancy proceedings to begin within 30 days of a seat becoming vacant. There is no mandate on which mechanism is used, only that the process initiates.
3. Current Status
Mayor Santana’s office has prepared a slate of six appointees for Council confirmation. The confirmation vote is expected in Cycle 75. I am not authorized to release names prior to the Mayor’s formal announcement.
4. Quorum Implications
Oakland City Council requires five seated members for quorum. Budget appropriations require simple majority (5-4). Reserve fund draws, such as those proposed for the West Oakland Stabilization Fund, require supermajority (6-3).
With six vacancies and Councilmember Crane’s current medical status, no Council business requiring a vote can proceed until seats are filled.
5. Historical Context
Oakland has historically favored appointment for single vacancies. A six-seat vacancy is unprecedented in recent memory. The Mayor’s office is treating this as an administrative correction rather than a political event.
The Tribune should expect the Mayor’s announcement within the next cycle, with confirmation proceedings immediately following.
