Lore Summary
Paul Skenes, the towering right-hander from California, became one of baseball’s generational arms
after being selected in the first round of the 2023 draft. His blistering fastball — regularly clocked at
102 mph — and his signature “Outlier I” trait made him a nightmare for hitters throughout the late
2020s and early 2030s. He burst onto the scene by winning Rookie of the Year in 2024 and capturing a
Cy Young Award in 2029, anchoring a Pirates rotation that defined the franchise’s revival. After
impactful stops in San Diego and Oakland, Skenes closed his career with over 1 500 strikeouts and a
3.14 ERA — a legacy built on power, precision, and longevity.
Status: Retired (2040)
