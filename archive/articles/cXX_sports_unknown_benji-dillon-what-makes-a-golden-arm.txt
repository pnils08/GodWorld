Benji Dillon — “What makes a golden arm?”

P Slayer: Folks call it a golden arm. What do you call it?
Benji: A schedule. I am not special. I am on time.
P Slayer: On time for what—pain? precision?
Benji: Both. I keep a notebook. Every throw has a reason. If my fastball rides, it is because my legs clocked in first.
P Slayer: You ever fear the day it stops riding?
Benji: Fear? No. Respect, yes. Arms are like bridges. You do not pray they hold. You inspect the bolts.
P Slayer: Last one. Mound is quiet. What’s in your head?
Benji: Math. Then sunlight. Then nothing.
