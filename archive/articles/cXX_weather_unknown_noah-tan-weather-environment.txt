“The November Volatility: When Weather Stops Making Sense”
November 30th through December 3rd has been meteorologically weird.
Not dangerous. Not unprecedented. Just… off.
Look at the temperature swings:
	∙	Nov 30th, 11 PM: 50°F, rain
	∙	Nov 30th, 11:13 PM: 45°F, rain (5-degree drop in 13 minutes)
	∙	Dec 1st, 7:38 AM: 47°F, cold and dry
	∙	Dec 3rd, 3:40 PM: 49°F, fog
That’s a 5-degree plunge in less than a quarter hour on the 30th, followed by rapid stabilization, then fog rolling in on the 3rd despite no marine layer advisory from the National Weather Service.
The fog on December 3rd had a weather impact rating of 1.3—higher than the rain events earlier in the week. Visibility dropped to under a quarter mile in Uptown and parts of Temescal. BART reported minor delays. Traffic load dipped to 0.72 (28% below baseline) as drivers stayed home or delayed commutes.
I checked with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. No alerts. No unusual particulate readings. Just fog—thick, sudden, and unforecasted.
Residents reported the fog felt “heavier” than normal. Maria Gutierrez in Fruitvale told me, “It wasn’t like regular fog. It was… denser? I don’t know how else to describe it.”
Meteorologically, there’s no mechanism for fog to feel “dense” beyond visibility reduction and humidity, both of which were within expected parameters. But seven people used similar language in my informal polling: heavy, thick, pressing.
The rapid temperature drops—two instances of “rapid temperature drop” logged in the civic event system on November 30th and December 1st—also don’t align with typical diurnal cooling patterns. We’d expect gradual evening descent, not 5-degree plunges in minutes.
Climate models don’t predict this kind of micro-volatility. It’s not a storm system. It’s not a pressure gradient. It’s just… weather doing something slightly wrong.
I’ve requested historical comparison data from NOAA for similar November-December patterns in the Bay Area over the last thirty years. Will update when that analysis is complete.
For now: dress in layers. The weather isn’t following its own rules.
