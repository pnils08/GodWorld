HAL RICHMOND — Senior Historian
“The Dismantling: When Championships Require Sacrifice”
Every dynasty ends. The question is whether it ends through entropy—slow decline, aging cores, diminishing returns—or through surgical intervention: trading away pieces while they still have value.
Oakland chose surgery.
The 2040 Athletics went 105-57 and lost Game 7 of the ALCS at home. They were close. Maddeningly close. One more pitcher, one more clutch hit, one less injury to Darrin Davis—any of those changes the outcome.
Instead of addressing those margins, Oakland dismantled the foundation.
The Cy Newell trade makes baseball sense: he’s 26, cost-controlled through 2042, and posted a 2.95 ERA across his callup. But he’s also unproven across a full season. George Whiteley was the #13 prospect in baseball. Agustin Rodriguez had a career year defensively. Peter Busch hit .259 with playoff power.
That’s not a trade. That’s a liquidation.
The return—Travis Coles—is legitimately special. At 21, with a 94 overall rating and a 2.05 ERA across 207 innings, he’s reminiscent of Paul Skenes in the 2027 trade that helped build this dynasty. If Coles ascends to 98 overall, this trade becomes the foundation of the next era.
But dynasties aren’t built on “if.”
The Jeremy McCracken acquisition is harder to defend historically. Oakland needed a lefty after declining to re-sign Benji Dillon, who finished 2nd in Cy Young voting at age 38. Instead, they traded Allen Lopez (career 3.83 ERA) and Antonio Castro (career year) for McCracken, a 33-year-old with declining velocity.
Benji wanted $12.5M for one year. McCracken cost two roster pieces and likely performs worse. The logic escapes me.
The Eric Tavares signing—seven years, $32.1M annually—is a bet on development during a win-now window. Tavares hit .237 last year. He’s 25, which means Oakland is paying for ages 25-31. That’s either brilliant foresight or catastrophic misallocation.
Compare to Isley Kelley, signed at 25 in a similar deal. Kelley became a perennial MVP candidate. But Kelley hit .242 with elite defense in his acquisition year. Tavares hit .237 with average defense. The gap matters.
The Deacon Seymour hire might be the boldest move. Mike Kindler went 105-57 and lost his job because the organization wanted… what, exactly? Youth? Innovation? Seymour has never managed a game. He’s the “hottest name on the market,” but hot doesn’t mean proven.
Oakland’s veteran core—Isley Kelley (14 years service time), Vinnie Keane (15 years), Mark Aitken, Danny Horn—doesn’t need a development-focused manager. They need a tactician who understands October pressure.
Seymour may be brilliant. Or he may learn on the job while the championship window narrows.
Edmundo Peña’s departure closes a chapter. Five All-Star appearances. Forty-two saves in 2040. Traded for Mariano Rosales, who’s 26 and unproven in October. The
move makes age-curve sense—Peña is 37, trending downward. But Peña was our closer. The guy who shut the door during three championships.
Trading him for future value means the organization believes the window is longer than one year. Trading Cy, Agustin, Busch, and Whiteley suggests the opposite: they believe they need Coles now.
Which is it? Win now or build for 2042-2045?
The offseason doesn’t answer that question. It just creates more.
I’ve covered this franchise for fifteen years. I’ve seen them build dynasties and dismantle them. This feels like both happening simultaneously—tearing down the 2037-2040 core while betting on a 2041-2044 window that may not exist if Coles, Tavares, or Seymour falters.
Mike Paulson may be in Chicago by spring. If he is, this offseason will be remembered as his final act: bold, controversial, and impossible to evaluate until 2042.
I hope he’s right. Because if he’s wrong, Oakland just traded away a championship window for a blueprint that never materializes.
