“The Suspicious Activity Paradox: When ‘See Something, Say Something’ Means Nothing’s Wrong”
Incident Analysis – Cycles 29 and 35
Two “suspicious activity” calls were logged and resolved during the high-signal period. Both followed the same pattern: concerned citizen report, officer response, no criminal activity found, no report filed.
This is standard procedure. But the nature of the calls reveals something about how Oakland was experiencing ambient stress.
I spoke with Officer Sarah Chen, 29, who responded to the Cycle 29 call in Fruitvale:
“Caller reported ‘someone acting strange’ near a bus stop. I arrived within four minutes. Individual was standing still, staring at nothing. I approached, identified myself, asked if everything was okay. He looked at me confused, said he was waiting for the bus. I asked how long he’d been standing there. He said ‘a few minutes.’ The caller—who stayed on scene—said it had been fifteen minutes and the person hadn’t moved the entire time. Didn’t check their phone, didn’t look at the bus schedule, just stood there.”
Chen’s report: No crime, no mental health crisis indicators, no intoxication. Subject was coherent, polite, had valid ID, and was indeed waiting for a bus.
“The weird part,” Chen told me, “was that the guy had no idea he’d been standing there that long. He genuinely thought it had been three or four minutes. When I told him fifteen, he pulled out his phone to check the time, and you could see him realize I was right. He apologized for ‘spacing out.’ But he wasn’t on drugs. He wasn’t mentally ill. He just… lost time.”
This matches the symptom profile documented in the Laurel and Uptown health clusters: transient cognitive disruption, time discontinuity, brief episodes of disorientation.
The Cycle 35 suspicious activity call in Uptown followed a similar pattern.
Officer DeShawn Miller, 38, responded:
“Call came in about a woman sitting in her car in a parking lot ‘acting suspicious.’ I arrived, approached the vehicle. Woman was sitting in driver’s seat, engine off, hands on the steering wheel, staring forward. I knocked on the window. She startled—like she’d been asleep but her eyes were open. Rolled down the window, immediately apologetic. Said she’d pulled over because she ‘felt weird’ and wanted to sit for a minute before driving. I asked how long she’d been sitting. She said ‘maybe five minutes.’ Security footage later showed twenty-three minutes.”
Miller’s assessment: No crime, no DUI, no medical emergency. Subject drove away safely after a field sobriety check showed zero impairment.
“But here’s what bothers me,” Miller said. “She felt weird, so she pulled over. That’s responsible behavior. But she lost twenty-three minutes and didn’t know it. If she’d kept driving instead of pulling over, would she have lost those twenty-three minutes behind the wheel? That’s a public safety concern.”
The Classification Problem:
OPD incident classification requires criminal activity, threat to safety, or medical emergency to generate a full report. “Person experiencing brief disorientation” doesn’t fit any category.
So these incidents get logged as “suspicious activity check, resolved without incident.”
But what if they’re not isolated incidents? What if they’re symptoms of a broader pattern that intersects with public safety but doesn’t meet criminal classification?
Lt. Marcus Vega, OPD Public Information Officer:
“We’ve coordinated with Alameda County Public Health regarding the health cluster investigations. If officers encounter individuals experiencing symptoms consistent with the documented clusters, we’re instructed to offer medical referral information. But we can’t force someone to seek medical attention if they’re not presenting immediate danger to self or others.”
I requested data on how many “suspicious activity” or “welfare check” calls during Cycles 26-35 involved reports of individuals “acting strange,” “spacing out,” or “standing still.”
OPD provided aggregate data: fourteen calls across nine cycles matching those descriptors. All resolved without incident. None resulted in arrests, citations, or medical transport.
Fourteen people, across multiple neighborhoods, reported by concerned citizens for behavior that looked wrong but wasn’t criminal.
Community Impact:
Xavier Williams, 26, retail worker from Chinatown, was the subject of one of those fourteen calls (he gave permission to be identified):
“I was walking home from work during Cycle 31. Next thing I know, there’s a cop asking if I’m okay. I said yes. He said someone called because I’d been standing on the corner for ten minutes. I have no memory of that. I remember walking, then talking to the cop. That’s it. He was nice about it, made sure I could get home safe. But it scared me. What happened to those ten minutes?”
This is the intersection of public safety and public health: when symptoms present in public spaces, triggering legitimate concern from witnesses, but don’t meet criteria for police or medical intervention.
Officer Sarah Chen:
“We’re trained for crime, crisis, and medical emergencies. We’re not trained for ‘person lost time but seems fine now.’ That’s a gap. If this is a health issue, it needs a health response. But if people are experiencing these symptoms in public—walking, driving, operating equipment—there’s a safety dimension we can’t ignore.”
Recommendation:
The intersection of the health cluster investigations and public safety response requires coordination between OPD and Alameda County Public Health. Residents experiencing these symptoms should:
	1.	Pull over if driving
	2.	Sit down if walking
	3.	Seek medical evaluation even if symptoms resolve
	4.	Report incidents to public health hotline: (510) 267-8000
“See something, say something” remains valid. But “something” might be a public health symptom, not a crime.

“Minor Pursuits, Major Questions: Why Two Vehicle Chases Ended Without Incident”
Incident Review – Cycles 20 and 22
Two vehicle pursuits during the high-signal period both terminated voluntarily—meaning the driver stopped without force, intervention, or crash.
That’s unusual. Not impossible, but unusual.
Pursuit protocols in Oakland follow strict guidelines established after the 2015 policy reforms. Officers initiate pursuit only for violent felonies or immediate public safety threats. They terminate pursuit if risk exceeds benefit.
Both Cycle 20 and Cycle 22 pursuits were initiated for traffic violations that escalated when drivers failed to yield. Both ended when drivers pulled over voluntarily after brief pursuit.
I reviewed incident reports for both cases (names redacted per policy):
Cycle 20 – Broadway Corridor:
	•	Initial stop: Failure to signal lane change
	•	Driver did not yield, accelerated
	•	Pursuit duration: 2.3 miles, approximately 4 minutes
	•	Termination: Driver pulled into gas station, exited vehicle, hands raised
	•	Driver statement: “I don’t know why I didn’t stop. I heard the siren, saw the lights, and I just kept driving. Then suddenly I thought ‘what am I doing?’ and pulled over.”
	•	Chemical test: Negative for drugs/alcohol
	•	Citation issued for traffic violations, reckless driving
	•	No arrest, no injuries
Cycle 22 – East Oakland:
	•	Initial stop: Expired registration
	•	Driver did not yield, made evasive turns
	•	Pursuit duration: 1.8 miles, approximately 3 minutes
	•	Termination: Driver stopped mid-block, placed hands on steering wheel
	•	Driver statement: “I saw the lights and panicked. I don’t know why. I’ve never run from police before. Then I just… came back to myself and stopped.”
	•	Chemical test: Negative for drugs/alcohol
	•	Citation issued for traffic violations, failure to yield
	•	No arrest, no injuries
Officer Perspective:
Officer Marcus Reed, 41, pursuing officer in Cycle 20 incident:
“Twenty years on the job, I’ve never had a pursuit end like that. Driver was actively evading—lane changes, acceleration, clear intent to flee—then just… stopped. Got out with hands up like he’d woken up from a dream. When I approached, he was apologetic, confused about why he’d run. Said it ‘seemed like the right thing to do at the time’ but couldn’t explain why.”
Officer Lisa Tran, 36, pursuing officer in Cycle 22 incident:
“Driver made three turns clearly designed to evade. Then stopped in the middle of the street—not at a curb, not in a safe location, just stopped. When I approached, she was crying. Said she’d never done anything like that before, didn’t know why she ran. Her driving record confirmed it—clean for twelve years.”
Pattern Analysis:
Both drivers:
	•	Had no prior history of evading police
	•	Tested negative for intoxicants
	•	Could not explain their behavior
	•	Described feeling like they “came back to themselves” when they stopped
	•	Used language suggesting discontinuity: “I don’t know what I was thinking,” “It was like I wasn’t myself”
This resembles the cognitive disruption pattern documented in health clusters and suspicious activity calls: brief loss of normal decision-making capacity, followed by return to baseline with limited memory of the disrupted period.
Lt. Marcus Vega, OPD:
“We’ve flagged these incidents for review in conjunction with the health cluster investigation. If environmental factors or health conditions are affecting cognitive function, that has implications for traffic safety and pursuit policies.”
Public Safety Implications:
If drivers are experiencing brief episodes of altered decision-making, the implications extend beyond these two incidents:
	•	How many traffic violations during this period were influenced by cognitive disruption?
	•	Should medical evaluation be offered to drivers exhibiting unusual decision patterns?
	•	Do pursuit policies account for health-related cognitive impairment?
Dr. Patricia Nwosu, Deputy Health Officer for Alameda County:
“We’re aware of the OPD reports. Behavioral changes—including impulsive decision-making or poor judgment—can be symptoms of neurological disruption. However, we need more data to establish causality. We’re requesting traffic incident data for the cycle period to look for patterns.”
Community Concern:
Hector Martinez, 22, janitor from Piedmont Avenue, witnessed the Cycle 20 pursuit:
“I was pumping gas when the car pulled in with cops behind it. Driver got out looking completely confused. Cops were professional, but you could tell they were confused too. It wasn’t a normal pursuit. Something was off about the whole thing.”
No Active Threat:
Both drivers completed field sobriety checks, received medical evaluation, and were cleared to drive. Neither showed signs of ongoing impairment.
But the question remains: if cognitive disruption can cause a driver to flee police and then stop without understanding why, what else might it cause on Oakland’s roads?
Traffic Safety Advisory:
Drivers experiencing confusion, disorientation, or any cognitive disruption should:
	•	Pull over immediately in a safe location
	•	Turn on hazard lights
	•	Call for assistance
	•	Do not resume driving until evaluated
