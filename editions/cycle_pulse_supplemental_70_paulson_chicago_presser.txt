PAULSON BREAKS SILENCE ON OAKLAND WALKOUT
First public acknowledgment of health crisis misstep comes from Chicago podium

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — Mike Paulson addressed the Oakland press conference walkout for the first time Tuesday, calling his comments during the city's ongoing health crisis "insensitive" and acknowledging he "overstepped" when speaking on the situation.

"I'll admit there were some unfortunate circumstances," Paulson said from the United Center press room, where he had gathered to discuss the Bulls' NBA Cup semifinal run. "I misspoke on the health crisis when I should have kept my enthusiasm to my faith in the Oakland health community's ability to handle the situation."

It was the first time the dual-franchise executive has publicly addressed the incident, which saw him abruptly leave a presser weeks ago after questions about Oakland's health situation turned pointed. The silence that followed stretched across multiple cycles while Temescal and other neighborhoods continued reporting elevated illness rates.

"I realize the health crisis is still lingering and I shouldn't have spoken on the topic," Paulson continued. "I acknowledge the insensitivity of the conversation and the conversation taking on a tone I felt I needed to just remove myself from."

When pressed for a direct message to Oakland residents still dealing with health concerns, Paulson pivoted to support.

"My message to anyone still dealing with the crisis is to seek local health services and make sure these cases are logged so the proper treatment is rolled out. I continue to support the health community in every way I'm able."

The acknowledgment came during what was otherwise a celebratory availability. The Bulls sit one win from the NBA Cup Finals, a position no one projected for the young franchise entering the season. But the Oakland questions found their way into the room — as they always do when Paulson takes a podium in either city.

Asked directly about his whereabouts if Chicago closes out its semifinal while spring training opens in Mesa, Paulson offered only: "My role is and will always be to serve the teams and put the best products forward. Wherever that takes me, that's where I'll be."

The non-answer satisfied no one. But the walkout acknowledgment gave Oakland something it hadn't received in weeks: a response.

CHICAGO REPORT

BULLS ONE WIN AWAY — PAULSON TEMPERS EXPECTATIONS DESPITE SURGE

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The Bulls are one game from the NBA Cup Finals. Mike Paulson isn't ready to call it a arrival.

"I can admit we are operating a bit ahead of even my expectations," Paulson said Tuesday. "We aren't shying away from the success but also are tempering expectations with such a young core."

That core — Josh Giddey, Matas Buzelis (21), Hank Trepagnier (21), and Adash Stanley (19) — has exceeded every external projection. Giddey is flirting with triple-double averages. Trepagnier has emerged as the most efficient big man in the Eastern Conference. Stanley, the 19-year-old spark plug from Poland, has provided energy off the bench that veteran teams can't match.

"We plan to develop these young players this season," Paulson said. "We've accumulated draft picks already. We will build and strike to add when the opportunity lends itself."

The timeline question looms over everything. Is this a team built to win now, or is the Cup run ahead of schedule?

Paulson's answer suggested the latter — but with no intention of pumping the brakes.

"As we've shown in Oakland, we plan to develop," he said, invoking the A's dynasty model that has defined his executive career. The implication was clear: Chicago is the second franchise built in that image. The system travels.

Veterans like Kevin Huerter have helped stabilize the locker room, Paulson noted, keeping daily routines intact while the young players handle the spotlight.

The city has noticed. Energy in Chicago is different. Conversations have shifted. Belief has returned to a franchise that spent years wandering.

One win away. No one saw it coming — including, by his own admission, the man running both teams.

MEANWHILE IN MESA: CLUBHOUSE WAITS, QUESTIONS LINGER

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Mike Paulson praised Deacon Seymour from a podium 1,800 miles away Tuesday. The clubhouse in Mesa is still waiting to hear it in person.

"We are extremely excited for what Deacon brings to the A's," Paulson said during his Chicago availability, deferring deeper comments to "the coming weeks." He acknowledged reports of the lineup leak that undermined Seymour's first days as manager but offered little clarity.

"I'm aware of the reporting thus far, but I also have my own experiences of seeing him with the team," Paulson said.

Spring training opens this week. Seymour has never managed a professional game. The roster is talented but watching. The front office is present but the GM is in Chicago, addressing walkouts and celebrating a basketball team's unexpected rise.

When asked directly when he'd land in Arizona, Paulson sidestepped.

The A's have operated in silence for cycles. Paulson's acknowledgment of the Oakland walkout may provide closure on one front. But the baseball questions remain open.

Mesa waits.

OPINION
############################################################

HE SAID THE WORDS. NOW WHAT?

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

He finally said it.

Not from Oakland. Not from the Coliseum. Not from anywhere that smells like the Bay. From Chicago. From a basketball podium. From the city that's getting the version of Mike Paulson that shows up for the bright lights.

"Insensitive." His word. "Overstepped." His word.

Look, I'm not here to pile on. The man acknowledged what happened. That's more than we've gotten in weeks. The walkout hung over everything — the health crisis still unresolved, the questions still unanswered, and the GM just... gone.

Now he's back. Sort of. On a screen. From a press room where they're celebrating a basketball team we're supposed to care about because his name is attached.

And maybe that's the tension we're all going to have to live with. Paulson built something here. The A's are his. The system is his. The dynasty — if we're still calling it that — is his. But attention is finite. You can only be in one room at a time.

He said when asked about where he'd be if the Bulls close it out: "Wherever that takes me, that's where I'll be."

That's the answer. That's always been the answer. We just didn't want to hear it.

Spring training opens. Deacon Seymour's got questions. The clubhouse has questions. Oakland has questions.

Paulson gave us two words from Chicago: insensitive and overstepped.

He's not wrong. But words from 1,800 miles away only go so far.

CITY BUZZING, BUT OAKLAND'S GHOST IN THE ROOM

By Talia Finch | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The United Center press room was supposed to be about basketball. For twenty minutes, it almost was.

Paulson fielded questions about the young core, the development timeline, the unexpected Cup run. He praised Giddey. He credited Huerter. He talked about the system he built in Oakland finally showing up on a second coast.

Then Oakland showed up in a different way.

The walkout question landed like a change in air pressure. Paulson didn't dodge. He didn't deflect. He took it.

The room shifted. Chicago media — there for basketball — watched the Bay Tribune reporters pull the conversation somewhere else entirely. This is what covering Paulson means now. Two cities. Two franchises. Two sets of unfinished business in every room he enters.

He left the podium without committing to either city for the next week. Spring training or Cup Finals. A's or Bulls. The man who built a dynasty by being everywhere is now stretched between two places that both need him present.

Chicago got the words today. The energy. The answers.

Oakland got an apology from 1,800 miles away.
