**The Document Oakland Has Been Waiting For**

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Ledger

The Baylight Draft Environmental Impact Report landed this week — 252 pages of what a thirty-five-thousand-seat stadium, thirty-two hundred residential units, and sixty-five acres of waterfront redevelopment will actually do to Oakland.

The headlines will focus on the big numbers. They should. But the details are where the tension lives.

The DEIR, prepared under the direction of Dr. Leanne Wu, the city's Director of Sustainability, lays out what the Baylight District project will generate in traffic alone: twelve thousand to fifteen thousand vehicle trips per event day. That number lands on I-880 interchanges, spills onto arterial roads, and increases transit demand at Lake Merritt BART — a station already running at capacity during rush hour.

The document proposes mitigation: a dedicated pedestrian bridge to BART, expanded ferry routes, AC Transit priority lanes, six hundred secure bike spaces. Whether those measures can absorb fifteen thousand cars on a game night is the question nobody has answered yet. The DEIR itself classifies the residual traffic impact as "significant but mitigable with aggressive transit adoption targets." That word — aggressive — is doing a lot of work.

The environmental picture is complicated. The thirty-month construction phase will produce diesel particulate matter, fugitive dust, and greenhouse gas emissions from a peak workforce of eighty-five hundred. Mitigation includes Tier 4 equipment requirements and electrified staging zones. On the operational side, the project proposes a microgrid with forty percent renewable generation and rooftop solar across the residential towers. Net greenhouse gas output is projected to remain below regional thresholds — if every mitigation measure is implemented.

Then there's the water. The DEIR models a three-point-five-foot sea-level rise scenario and requires a shoreline resilience plan. The project sits on former harbor and industrial parcels with known contamination zones — soils that will need excavation, removal, and environmental remediation bonding funded by the developer.

On the housing side, the project's thirty-two hundred residential units include eighteen hundred deed-restricted affordable units — fifty-six percent of total housing. That's a significant commitment. But the DEIR also acknowledges potential risks: nearby rent escalation and retail displacement pressure. The proposed mitigation includes a Community Benefits Oversight Board, thirty percent small business lease priority, and a two-point-five-million-dollar annual community fund.

The variable tax structure that would fund the district's infrastructure has still not been detailed in legislative language. The council vote is two weeks away — Cycle 83. The projection is a five-to-four split, with Councilmembers Ramon Vega and Leonard Tran as the swing votes. Tran is currently leaning yes.

Marco Lopez, a forty-year-old mechanic from Laurel, went looking for Baylight documents last month and couldn't find them. This week, there are 252 pages waiting for him. "I wanted to know what twelve thousand cars on event day looks like for my neighborhood," Lopez said when reached by phone. "Now I can read it for myself. That's all I wanted."

Dr. Leanne Wu did not comment beyond the document itself. The public comment period is open.

**OARI: One Week to the Vote, and the Mailboxes Are Full**

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Investigations

The Oakland Alternative Response Initiative goes to council vote next week — Cycle 82, five-to-four required, twelve-point-five million dollars on the line.

And the Oakland Police Officers Association wants you to know exactly what they think about it.

OPOA mailers have been hitting District 4 mailboxes for the past two weeks, targeting the district represented by Councilmember Ramon Vega — one of two swing votes on the initiative. The mailers frame OARI as a risk to public safety, emphasizing response times and officer allocation. They do not mention the initiative's mental health crisis intervention component, its community mediation program, or the eighteen-month pilot structure that would allow evaluation before permanent funding.

What's missing is any counter-campaign. The OPP bloc — Carter, Delgado, Rivers, and Mobley — has pushed OARI through committee and onto the floor. But they have not matched the OPOA's direct-mail effort. No mailers. No public events in District 4. No visible push to reach Vega's constituents before the vote.

Vega himself has not made a public statement on OARI since the committee hearing. His office declined to comment on his current position. Leonard Tran, the other swing vote, voted YES on the Health Center appropriation last week — but policing is a different question than healthcare, and Tran's position on OARI remains a toss-up.

The CRC bloc — Ashford, Chen, and Crane — are expected to vote NO. That puts the math at four YES, three NO, and two undecided — with Crane's status still unclear after his absence from the Health Center vote.

Dante Nelson, a forty-one-year-old security guard in Downtown, has been receiving the OPOA mailers. "I got three this week," Nelson said. "Three. They're spending money to make sure I'm scared. I'd rather hear what the alternative actually looks like."

The vote is next week. The mailers keep coming. The counter-argument hasn't arrived yet.

**After the Vote: Temescal Waits for Its Clinic**

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Ledger

The Temescal Health Center appropriation passed six-to-two last week. The clinic is funded. The district celebrated. And then Temescal went back to waiting.

The vote itself was not close. Carter, Tran, Delgado, Vega, Rivers, and Mobley voted YES. Nina Chen voted NO, as expected. Warren Ashford — District 7, which includes Temescal — also voted NO. Against his own district's clinic.

Elliott Crane, District 6, was absent. His office cited a medical issue. No timeline for return has been provided. It is the second consecutive vote Crane has missed.

The story this week is not the vote. It's what happens after.

Jose Johnson is a sixty-two-year-old warehouse worker in Temescal. He said before the vote that he would remember how Ashford voted. He remembers. "He looked us in the eye at the town hall and said he'd fight for the neighborhood," Johnson said. "Then he voted against the one thing we asked for. I don't forget that."

The clinic itself is still months from opening. The appropriation funds design, permitting, and initial construction. Temescal residents who need care now — for the health conditions that prompted the appropriation in the first place — are still driving to other neighborhoods or waiting for mobile clinic days.

The vote passed. The money is allocated. But the building doesn't exist yet. And the councilmember who represents the district voted against it.

Temescal is watching.

BUSINESS TICKER

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

Summer's bringing foot traffic back to commercial corridors across Oakland. Retail activity is noticeably heavier than it's been since spring, and the tourism bump is showing up in longer lines at waterfront spots and busier weekday afternoons downtown. Jack London's evening scene is particularly active — restaurants running weekend wait times on weeknights, bars filling up earlier.

The Stabilization Fund's 45-day disbursement window is now open, but the money hasn't started moving yet. I spoke with Darius Clark, a bakery worker in West Oakland, who said he submitted his application two weeks ago and was told to expect a response "within the review period." The form itself was four pages. The wait continues.

Dining trends: Waterfront restaurants in Jack London are seeing the biggest bump — casual spots pulling steady crowds through the week. Fast-casual places near Uptown are busier during lunch hours. Nightlife volume is up across the board, with Jack London leading. Active spots include venues near the waterfront, bars along Broadway, and late-night spots in Uptown holding crowds past midnight.

The Baylight Draft Environmental Impact Report notes 8,500 peak construction jobs and a $2.5 million annual community fund if the project moves forward. Those numbers are projections, not commitments — but they're the first concrete economic footprint attached to the district since the vote.

Retail corridors are holding steady. Commercial foot traffic is elevated but not overwhelming. The tourist bump isn't transforming the landscape — it's just filling tables that were half-empty in May.

**Before the Money Arrives**

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

The Cathedral of Christ the Light's food pantry on Saturday morning served 47 families by 10 a.m. By noon, Rafael Phillips, 26, a server from Fruitvale who volunteers on weekends, had counted 89. By the time they locked the doors at 2 p.m., he'd stopped counting.

"We ran out of canned vegetables around one," Phillips said, standing in the empty pantry hallway, still wearing his volunteer badge. "We don't usually run out of anything."

Across town in East Oakland, Allen Temple Baptist Church marked a milestone this week — their seniors lunch program served its 10,000th meal since the program relaunched after the pandemic. In Temescal, the Islamic Center of Oakland held a community grief gathering on Thursday night, drawing dozens to process loss together. In Lake Merritt, First Unitarian Church opened their doors for an emergency food distribution after their regular pantry day had already passed.

It's been a week of faith institutions doing what they've always done — showing up when the city needs holding together. But the pace feels different. Emergency funds. Grief gatherings. Food pantries running at elevated capacity.

The Stabilization Fund passed the full council 6-3 three weeks ago. The disbursement window is open. But the money hasn't moved. The city's faith communities aren't waiting for the bureaucracy to catch up.

"People need to eat now," Phillips said. "They need somewhere to sit with their grief now. The vote doesn't change that."

Andre Lee, 55, an electrician from Temescal who volunteers at both Allen Temple and Acts Full Gospel Church programs, said he's seen this before. "We did this during the pandemic," Lee said. "We did it during the recession. We'll keep doing it whether the money shows up or not. That's what faith communities do — we show up."

The Islamic Center's grief gathering was the only event this week noted by city observers as requiring additional community support — a recognition that the work of processing collective loss requires space and witness. Dozens attended. No one I spoke with wanted to be named. They came, they sat, they left lighter than they arrived.

The Summer Festival starts this weekend in West Oakland. There will be music, food, celebration. But before the festival, before the disbursements arrive — if they arrive on time — the city's faith communities are already doing the work.

"Eighty-nine families today," Phillips said again, like he was trying to remember the number for later. "We'll need more vegetables next week."

**When the Night Stretches Long**

By Kai Marston | Bay Tribune Arts & Entertainment

By ten o'clock Saturday night, Jack London had that hum — the sound of a neighborhood that decided to stay awake a little longer. Warehouse doors open, music spilling onto Webster Street, clusters of people moving between venues like they had all night and nowhere else to be.

The sky had been overcast all day, that thick summer gray that makes the city feel smaller, more contained. But the weather didn't slow anyone down. If anything, it made the indoor spaces feel warmer, more necessary.

Jalen Hill, 35, works the line at a spot on 3rd Street. He's lived in Jack London for six years, long enough to know when a weekend feels different. "This is the busiest Saturday we've had since April," he said, checking orders on his phone during a rare break. "We're not complaining. But it's a lot."

The nightlife this week showed Jack London at its highest activity level of the summer — not chaotic, not out of control, just sustained. People kept showing up. Venues stayed open later. The neighborhood absorbed it all without breaking stride.

Marcus Walker, 48, who washes dishes at the same restaurant, said he's noticed the shift too. "Used to be you'd see the same faces every weekend," Walker said. "Now it's different people every night. I don't know where they're all coming from, but they're here."

Some of it is the usual summer energy — warm nights, longer days, people wanting to be outside even when the sky's gray. Some of it is the optimism floating around the city since the Stabilization Fund passed council. Some of it is just Oakland being Oakland — a city that celebrates and questions at the same time, that holds joy and caution in the same hand.

I walked through three venues Saturday night. All of them were packed. The arts and nightlife movement that started building last week is still unfolding — Uptown, KONO, and Jack London all running hotter than usual, all feeding off each other's energy. The Summer Festival this weekend will pull some of that energy west to West Oakland. But Jack London isn't slowing down.

By midnight, the crowd had thinned slightly, but the venues were still open, still buzzing. The overcast sky made the streetlights feel warmer. The music kept spilling onto Webster. The city kept stretching the night a little longer, like it wasn't ready to let go yet.

"This is what summer in Oakland feels like," Hill said. "Busy, loud, alive. It'll calm down eventually. But not tonight."

**Quiet Work, No Headlines**

By Elliot Graye | Bay Tribune Religious Affairs

The East Bay Meditation Center's Obon observance on Friday evening drew the faithful to downtown Oakland for a ceremony honoring ancestors and the cycle of life. Lanterns were lit. Names were spoken. The work of remembering continued, as it does every summer.

On Saturday morning, St. Columba Catholic Church in Fruitvale hosted a community health fair — blood pressure screenings, health resources, information tables set up in the parish hall. No announcement beforehand. No press release after. Just neighbors showing up because someone told them there'd be help if they needed it.

In East Oakland, the congregation of Masjid Al-Islam spent Sunday afternoon volunteering for a neighborhood cleanup — trash bags, gloves, a route they'd mapped out weeks ago. By 4 p.m., they'd filled a pickup truck bed twice.

None of this made headlines. None of it was meant to.

The Temescal health situation that started weeks ago is still active. Faith institutions in the area — the Islamic Center of Oakland, churches, synagogues — have quietly stepped in to fill gaps. Food. Grief support. Emergency funds. Health resources.

Across the city, the pattern repeats. Allen Temple Baptist Church, Acts Full Gospel Church, Cathedral of Christ the Light, First Unitarian Church — all running food pantries, emergency assistance programs, community gatherings. Some marking milestones this week. Some just keeping the doors open another day.

This isn't crisis response. It's not a reaction to one bad week. It's the steady work that faith communities do when the city's infrastructure has gaps and people fall through them.

I asked someone at the Masjid Al-Islam cleanup why they didn't announce it ahead of time — maybe get more volunteers, more coverage. They looked at me like I'd asked why they breathe.

"This is what we do," they said. "We don't need credit. We need trash bags."

**Aitken Shows Up Where It Matters**

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

The Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Baylight Stadium project dropped this week — 252 pages of traffic projections, emissions data, and sea-level rise modeling. The council vote is two weeks away. And Mark Aitken was in the room.

The Oakland A's third baseman sat in the gallery Tuesday afternoon when the DEIR was presented to the stadium oversight session. He did not speak. He did not ask questions. He was there to listen — which is what he has been doing for the better part of a year now, showing up in rooms where policy gets made and infrastructure gets debated before the city has fully digested the implications.

Aitken has attended four civic meetings since the stadium deal moved forward. This was the first time he brought company. Benji Dillon, the A's second baseman and three-time Gold Glove winner, sat two rows behind him. When the session opened for public comment, Dillon stood and took questions about the DEIR, the construction timeline, and what it means to play for a franchise that is building a stadium in a city still processing what twelve thousand vehicle trips per event day looks like.

"I trust the process," Dillon said when asked if he had read the full environmental assessment. "I trust the people running this. But I also think it matters that we're here. We're not just players. We live here."

The DEIR is now in public circulation. Two weeks remain before the bond vote. The document reveals significant but mitigable impacts — traffic congestion during events, shoreline vulnerability under a three-point-five-foot sea-level rise scenario, and thirty months of construction emissions. It also details the economic footprint: eighty-five hundred peak construction jobs, a two-point-five-million-dollar annual community fund, and thirty percent small business lease priority.

Mike Paulson, the A's general manager who has spent the last six weeks splitting time between Oakland, Mesa, and Chicago, attended the session remotely via video link. He did not speak on the record but was seen taking notes throughout. Sources close to the front office say Paulson has been in regular contact with city officials about the bond timeline.

Aitken left the session without speaking to reporters. Dillon stayed for thirty minutes afterward, answering questions in the hallway. He was asked why players are showing up to meetings about a stadium they will not play in for another five years.

"Because it's our city," Dillon said. "Not just our team."

The bond vote is scheduled for Cycle 83 — two weeks out. The DEIR is public. The clock is running.

**They Keep Showing Up**

By P Slayer | Bay Tribune Sports

Mark Aitken sat in the gallery at the Baylight DEIR session Tuesday afternoon and did not say a word. Benji Dillon answered questions in the hallway afterward for thirty minutes. Neither of them had to be there. Neither of them got anything out of it except the knowledge that they were in the room when the numbers were laid out.

This is what we have now. This is what Oakland has. Players who show up.

I have been writing about this team for eight years. I have watched front offices come and go. I have watched ownership groups promise investment and deliver excuses. I have watched general managers walk out of press conferences and disappear for six weeks while the city waited for an explanation. And now I am watching Mark Aitken sit through a presentation on twelve thousand vehicle trips and sea-level rise projections for a stadium he will not play in for another five years because he thinks it matters to be there.

It does matter. Not because Aitken has a vote. Not because Dillon's opinion on environmental assessments carries legal weight. It matters because they are modeling what it looks like when athletes treat the city like it is more than a logo on a jersey.

The DEIR dropped this week. The city finally has the document. Two hundred and fifty-two pages of what Baylight will actually mean — the traffic, the construction emissions, the contaminated soils, the shoreline resilience plan. It's a lot to absorb. And the players are already in the room absorbing it.

This is not normal. This is not how professional sports works. Players do not sit through environmental review presentations. They do not take questions about traffic mitigation strategies. They do not show up to bond presentations for infrastructure they will never use. They hire agents to negotiate contracts and publicists to write statements and they focus on the game.

But Vinnie Keane played wiffleball in Temescal two weeks ago with Danny Horn and half the roster because Horn wanted to raise money for youth programs and Keane thought showing up was worth more than writing a check. And Mark Aitken keeps attending civic meetings because he lives in Piedmont Avenue and he thinks policy matters. And Benji Dillon stood in a hallway after a two-hour session answering questions from reporters and citizens because he thinks "we live here" is a reason to care.

This team is in the middle of spring training. Deacon Seymour is running his first season as manager. Keane is playing his final year in green and gold. The A's open against San Diego in two weeks. They could be focused on that. They are focused on that.

And they are also here. In the rooms where the DEIR gets presented. In the neighborhoods where the stadium will change everything. In the hallways after the sessions, answering questions, because someone thought to ask.

Oakland, do you see this? This is what it looks like when a franchise invests in a city. Not with press releases. Not with charity checks and photo ops. With time. With presence. With players who think being in the room matters.

The bond vote is two weeks away. The DEIR is public. The city is about to make a two-point-one-billion-dollar decision on infrastructure it has finally been given the data to evaluate.

And the players are already there. Listening. Asking. Staying.

That is the story.

**The Dynasty That Stayed**

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports

Forty-four years. That is how long I have been covering Oakland baseball. I have written about dynasties that left, championships that ended, players who retired and disappeared into quiet lives in other cities. I have written eulogies for eras that died before anyone thought to celebrate them.

This time is different.

The Oakland A's announced this week that the 2041 season will honor Vinnie Keane, Benji Dillon, and the championship era they built. Not after they retire. Not ten years from now when the nostalgia has softened the edges and the details have blurred into legend. Now. While Keane is still playing. While Dillon is still taking ground balls at second. While the dynasty is still here.

Keane is in his final season. He has not said when he will retire — he does not need to. The city knows. The team knows. He knows. This is the farewell tour whether he calls it that or not. He played wiffleball in Temescal two weeks ago with Danny Horn and half the roster because Horn wanted to raise money for youth programs. He sat in the dugout during spring training and watched Deacon Seymour run his first practice as manager and told reporters afterward that Seymour "gets it." He has been here for fifteen years. He is not leaving quietly.

The dynasty celebration will bring back former players from the championship years. It will show the current roster what the expectation is. It will honor the men who built something that did not collapse when the parade ended. That is rare. Dynasties fall apart. Championships end. Players leave for bigger contracts or warmer weather or cities that do not ask them to care about bond votes and environmental reviews.

This one stayed.

Benji Dillon sat in the gallery at the Baylight DEIR session Tuesday afternoon. Mark Aitken has attended four civic meetings since the stadium deal moved forward. Vinnie Keane played wiffleball in a Temescal park because he thought showing up mattered. These are not gestures. These are choices. Professional athletes choosing to invest in the city where they play. Not because the contract requires it. Because they think it matters.

I have covered six dynasties in this city. The Bash Brothers era ended in trades and acrimony. The Moneyball years collapsed under their own mythology. The early 2000s teams were dismantled before they ever became legends. I watched those eras die and wrote the retrospectives years later when it was safe to ask what went wrong.

This time I am writing the retrospective while the dynasty is still alive. While Keane is still playing. While Dillon is still answering questions in hallways after civic sessions. While the team is still here.

The 2041 celebration will honor the championship era. It will bring back the players who built it. It will show the current roster what continuity looks like. It will do all of this while Vinnie Keane is still in the lineup, still playing, still here.

That is the gift. Not the ceremony. Not the nostalgia. The fact that we get to celebrate it while it is still happening. While the men who built it are still in the room.

Forty-four years. I have never written this story before. I have never had the chance.

This time the dynasty stayed.

CHICAGO SPORTS

**The Numbers Don't Lie — Chicago Still Does**

By Selena Grant | Skyline Tribune

Let me give you the stat line first: 34 points, 10 rebounds, 17 assists. Josh Giddey posted that against the Pistons three weeks ago. His season averages sit at 18.7 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists per game. The Bulls are 39-16, best record in the Eastern Conference.

Josh Giddey is not an All-Star.

The All-Star selection process involves fan voting, media ballots, and player votes. The margins are often thin. Someone always gets left out. But when a player averaging near 19-7-7 on the best team in the conference doesn't make the cut, it's worth asking what narrative is being told about Chicago's roster.

The national conversation about the Bulls remains fixated on Hank Trepagnier — deservedly so. The rookie center is averaging 21.3 points and 10.2 rebounds, leading the Rookie of the Year race by a comfortable margin. Trepagnier is Chicago's future. But Giddey is Chicago's present, and the numbers say he's an elite two-way playmaker having the best season of his career.

During All-Star Weekend, Giddey and Trepagnier took part in community events on Chicago's South Side — youth basketball clinics, hospital visits, the standard circuit. Giddey didn't mention the snub. He talked about playoff positioning. He talked about what the Bulls still need to accomplish.

That's the veteran move. But it doesn't change the math.

Mike Paulson built this roster to win now. The Deon Whitfield trade at the deadline signaled that clearly enough. The Ayo Dosunmu extension — three years, $16.88 million — locked in depth pricing for a team that believes it can compete for a title. Walker Kessler's trade deadline value was reportedly high, and the Bulls kept him anyway. Every move says the same thing: this team is built to win in 2026.

If that's true, then Giddey's production should matter. He's the connective tissue between Trepagnier's interior dominance and the perimeter shooting that makes Chicago's offense work. He's averaging seven assists per game on a team that ranks fifth in offensive efficiency. He posted a 34-10-17 line in a win that pushed Chicago to 36-14.

And the national basketball media looked at that resume and said: not quite.

The counterargument is fair. The Eastern Conference guard rotation is stacked. There are only so many spots. Giddey's defensive metrics are middle-of-the-pack. His three-point shooting is solid but not elite. This isn't a robbery — it's a close call that went the other way.

But here's what the snub reveals: Chicago still isn't taken seriously as a basketball city. The Bulls have the best record in the East, an NBA Cup championship banner from December, and a rookie who might be the best player in his draft class. And the national conversation is still waiting to be convinced.

Giddey will keep doing what he's been doing. The Bulls will keep winning. At some point, the narrative catches up to the numbers. It always does.

The Bulls are 39-16. The playoffs will tell the rest.

CHICAGO GROUND

**The Weekend We Weren't Watching**

By Talia Finch | Skyline Tribune

The sky over Bridgeport on Saturday morning was the color of old concrete — overcast, heavy, the kind of Chicago weather that makes you wonder if summer is a real thing or just something that happens to other cities. The coffee at Bridgeport Grind was the same as always: dark, bitter, served in paper cups that burned your hand if you didn't grab a sleeve.

What wasn't the same was the mood.

"All-Star Weekend," said the woman behind the counter, stacking lids with the efficiency of someone who'd been doing this for twenty years. "Whole world's watching basketball, and our guys aren't even there."

She didn't need to say which guys. Everyone knew. Josh Giddey averaged 18.7 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists this season. The Bulls were 39-16, best record in the Eastern Conference. And Giddey was spending All-Star Weekend at a youth basketball clinic on the South Side instead of in the spotlight.

The clinic was at a rec center off 79th Street. About sixty kids showed up, most of them wearing Bulls gear that looked like it had been saved for a special occasion. Giddey and Hank Trepagnier spent two hours running drills, signing jerseys, taking photos with kids who couldn't believe they were standing next to the guys they'd watched on TV three nights earlier.

Trepagnier is the story everyone knows — the rookie center who leads the Rookie of the Year race, the future of the franchise. But it was Giddey the kids asked about. "Why didn't you make the All-Star team?" one of them said, no filter, just the blunt honesty of a twelve-year-old who doesn't understand how politics works.

Giddey smiled. "Still got a lot of basketball to play," he said. "Playoffs matter more."

That's the line you give when you're a professional. But the question hung in the gym long after he moved to the next drill.

Back at Bridgeport Grind, the woman behind the counter was still thinking about it. "This city knows what it's like to get overlooked," she said. She was wiping down the espresso machine now, talking more to herself than to me. "We've been doing this forever. Best team in the East, and the national guys still talk about us like we're lucky to be here."

That's the mood in Chicago right now. Pride mixed with something sharper. The Bulls are 39-16. They won the NBA Cup in December. They've got the best record in the conference. And the city still feels like it's proving something to people who aren't paying attention.

Giddey spent All-Star Weekend with kids on the South Side. Trepagnier was there too. The cameras weren't. Chicago noticed.

The coffee was bitter. The sky stayed gray. The season kept moving.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

Dear Editor,

I told you I would remember. Councilmember Ashford stood in front of us at the Temescal town hall and said he would fight for the neighborhood. He looked at the room full of people who need that clinic and said the words we wanted to hear. Then the vote came and he said no.

Six to two. We got our clinic anyway. But my councilmember — the one who represents my neighborhood, the one I voted for — voted against the one thing we asked him for. He knew what it meant. He knew people are driving twenty minutes to see a doctor because there's nothing close enough. He voted no anyway.

I'm sixty-two years old. I've worked in warehouses for thirty-one years. I don't ask for much. I asked for a clinic in my neighborhood and my own representative said no. I won't forget that. And I'll make sure the people on my block don't forget it either.

— Jose Johnson, 62, Temescal

-----

Dear Editor,

Six to two. The clinic passed. I cried when I heard, which I know sounds dramatic for a city council vote, but I've been waiting for this for a long time.

I'm a home health aide. I drive to people's homes in Temescal and take care of them — check their blood pressure, help them with medication, make sure they eat something. Half of them can't get to a doctor easily. The nearest clinic is a bus ride away, and for the people I care for, a bus ride might as well be a mountain.

Now we'll have something closer. Not tomorrow — the building has to be built, the permits filed, the construction done. Months. Maybe a year. But it's funded. It's real.

I want to thank the six who voted yes. And I want to say to Councilmember Ashford: I live in your district. I take care of your constituents. I don't understand your vote. But the clinic is coming anyway.

— Patricia Nolan, Temescal

Dear Editor,

I've been trying to find the Baylight documents for weeks. Last month I went to the planning office and they told me the environmental report wasn't ready yet. I checked the city website. Nothing. I asked around at the shop and nobody had seen anything either.

This week the DEIR came out. Two hundred and fifty-two pages. I'm a mechanic — I read technical documents all day, but this is something else. What caught my eye was the traffic section. Twelve thousand to fifteen thousand vehicle trips per event day. I live in Laurel. I-880 is already a mess during rush hour. What happens when you add fifteen thousand cars on top of that?

The document says "mitigable with aggressive transit adoption targets." That's a lot of words for "we hope people take the bus." I want to see the legislative language on the tax structure before the vote. I want to know what "aggressive" means in real numbers. The document is a start. But two weeks to read 252 pages and make a decision is not enough time.

— Marco Lopez, 40, Laurel

Dear Editor,

I've gotten three mailers from the OPOA this week about the police alternative initiative. Three. All of them telling me what the alternative response program will take away. None of them telling me what it would provide.

I work security downtown. I see the situations they're talking about — the mental health calls, the disputes that don't need a badge and a gun. I've watched officers respond to someone having a crisis on the sidewalk and thought, every single time, there has to be a better way to do this.

The OARI vote is next week. I'd like to hear from the people who support it. Not in a mailer. In person. Come to my neighborhood. Tell me what the plan is. Because right now the only people talking to me are the ones who want me to be afraid.

— Dante Nelson, 41, Downtown
