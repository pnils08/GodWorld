Next Men Up: Oakland’s Shadow Core
Las Vegas, Nevada — 2040

The desert heat hits different when you know you’re one phone call away from The Show. That’s life for the Las Vegas Aviators — the Athletics’ Triple‑A affiliate — a team built less on patience than on pressure. You can feel it in the dugout, in the way gloves snap tighter, in the way eyes track every pitch like it might be the one that finally punches their ticket to Oakland. The dynasty is still roaring up north, but in Vegas, it’s evolving — one young name at a time.

The Ones Knocking Loudest
At the top of the depth chart sits Ernesto Quintero, a twenty‑three‑year‑old third baseman built like a linebacker and hitting like one too — A‑potential, overall seventy‑nine. His swing looks familiar: disciplined, compact, a mirror image of Mark Aitken before Oakland called him up eight years ago. The problem? There’s no room at the corner. Aitken is still in his prime, and Martin Richards just put together another All‑Star season. Unless a trade breaks the logjam, Quintero is either blocked for another year or becomes the centerpiece in a deal that buys Oakland leverage where it needs it most.

Right behind him is Buford Park, a twenty‑three‑year‑old corner infielder with a similar problem — his path to the majors runs straight through the same blockade. His power plays, and he’s proven his glove can handle first or third. The smart money says one of Oakland’s established infielders will eventually move, but the organization’s patience with Park may run thin before that happens. He’s talented enough to headline a trade; he’s waiting for someone to make the call.

Arms in Limbo
On the mound, Cy Newell looks like the next homegrown rotation piece. Twenty‑six, overall eighty, with a ninety‑six mile‑per‑hour fastball and a cutter that dives like a ghost pitch. If this were any other organization, he’d be starting by June. But behind Rivas, Ramos, Dillon, Lopez, and Ellis, the door is locked. The A’s have five major‑league starters all rated eighty or higher. A contender would call that depth; a prospect calls it suffocation. Unless a trade opens a slot — maybe a contender desperate for veteran innings or a mid‑season injury that forces the issue — Newell will keep stockpiling quality starts under neon lights instead of Coliseum fog.

In the bullpen, Clark Saryan and Leo Lamar both look MLB‑ready. Saryan’s four‑pitch mix and steady command could slot cleanly behind Edmundo Peña or Ian Devine. Lamar, older and hungrier, feels like the kind of steady arm contenders steal in August for a playoff push. The A’s bullpen is full of veterans — Bautista, Devine, Ka, Peña — and someone will have to move before the next wave arrives. The same goes for Johnny Carter, who’s punching out hitters at a premium rate in Triple‑A but sits behind a hierarchy that hasn’t shifted in half a decade.

Position Battles and the Trade Whisper
The outfield situation is equally congested. Desmond Morton, twenty‑three years old with A‑potential, may be the most electric athlete in the system — speed seventy‑seven, steal seventy‑nine, reaction eighty‑two. But between Danny Horn, Vladimir González, and Peter Busch, there’s simply no room to breathe. Morton’s name has already started appearing in front‑office whispers — not as an expendable, but as an opportunity. He’s the kind of player a small‑market club might flip for a controllable starter or a top‑tier leverage reliever.

And then there’s David Sennett, twenty‑four, overall eighty‑four, Oakland’s heir to Isley Kelley who’s been blocked at shortstop for years. The front office loves him, but Kelley is under contract through twenty forty‑one. Unless they shift Sennett to second or include him in a headline trade for impact offense, he’ll continue haunting Triple‑A box scores like a ghost of the future. It’s not about readiness anymore — it’s about timing.

The Quiet Reality
For all the talk of organizational patience, everyone in Las Vegas knows what’s coming. Some of these names — Quintero, Sennett, Morton, Newell — will wear green and gold soon. Others will get the phone call no player wants but every franchise needs to make. That’s how dynasties stay alive — by sacrificing pieces to keep the machine humming.

In the clubhouse, Cy Newell summed it up best between innings: “We’re not waiting. We’re sharpening.” That’s Triple‑A baseball in the age of the Oakland empire — the tension between faith and frustration, every inning a résumé, every win a reminder that greatness is only one trade away.
