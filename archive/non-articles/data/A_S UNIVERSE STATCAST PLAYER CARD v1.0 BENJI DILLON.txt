CAREER IDENTIFIER

One of the greatest pitchers in A’s franchise history —
and one of the most statistically dominant left-handers in your universe.

Career totals:
200 W | 126 L | 2,787.2 IP | 3,219 SO | 3.58 ERA | 5× Cy Young
(2028, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2037)

No A’s pitcher has ever paired that much volume with that much dominance for that long.

PITCH ARSENAL (TRUE SOURCE + STATCAST INTERPRETATION)

4-Seam Fastball — 98 mph (peak), 94–96 now
• Once elite, now “just” very good
• Active spin still strong
• Elevated 4-seam remains his core strikeout pitch
• Late-career decline: –1.2 mph over last 3 seasons

Changeup — 80 mph
• His signature pitch
• Huge separation from fastball makes it deadly
• Generates weak contact + chase swings
• Still elite even with velo dip

Slider — 88 mph
• Hard, modern shape
• Second out-pitch behind the changeup
• Best vs. RHB

Curveball — 69 mph
• Show-me pitch
• Used to disrupt timing
• Effectiveness fading with age

Summary:
He’s transitioning from power-first ace to command-first technician.
This is exactly how elite careers age.

⸻

STATCAST CONTACT PROFILE

Hard-Hit%: Low allowed (elite sequencing)
Barrel% allowed: One of the lowest among veteran starters
Whiff% (pitcher): High — changeup responsible for most
Chase% induced: Excellent
xBA allowed: Consistently lower than real BA
xSLG allowed: Stable — rarely punished

Interpretation:
His underlying expected stats always outperform his surface ERA.

⸻

REVERSE SPLITS

vs RHB — Dominant
He is one of the rare LHPs better against righties.

vs LHB — Still strong, but aging shows here first.

⸻

SPRAY & ZONE PROFILE (PITCHING)

Hot zones:
• Elevated 4-seamer → whiffs
• Low-away changeup → chase + rollover contact

Cold zones (vulnerable):
• Middle-middle when fatigued
• Belt-high sliders left inside

⸻

SIM-BASED TRAITS

Stamina: 95
Command: 80
Clutch: 93
Pitch Control / Pitch Break trending DOWN slightly with age (–2 last season)

But even his “decline” years would be career seasons for most pitchers.

⸻

CAREER ARC PATTERN

Peak seasons:
2034–2037 (insane stretch, 2 Cy Youngs, 230+ K/year)

Aging seasons:
2038: 5.56 ERA (command dip)
2039: 4.29 ERA (velo stabilized)

2040 Projection:
Strong bounceback candidate —
early season peripherals show a return to form.

He ages like Justin Verlander + CC Sabathia hybrid.

⸻

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Dillon’s decline is overstated — his xERA and xSLG show he’s still near-elite.
• Fastball velocity drop is real, but the changeup remains unhittable.
• Command metrics have stabilized after a 2038 down year.
• He’s still a Cy Young contender in 2040 due to innings volume + K totals.
• No other pitcher in the system can replicate his sequencing skill.
• Projection: 12–15 more quality starts this season barring injury.

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“He’s the old lion who still scares the savannah.
You see the numbers dip, you think he’s done — then he throws seven shutout innings just to remind the world.
This man refuses to age like a normal human.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Great pitchers decline in two ways: suddenly or slowly.
Dillon refuses both.
He descends like a monarch — dignified, dangerous, and still feared.
When the story of this era is written, his name will anchor its chapters.”
