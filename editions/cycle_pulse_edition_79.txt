THE CHECK IS COMING — BUT WEST OAKLAND ISN'T HOLDING ITS BREATH

Forty-five days and counting: the Stabilization Fund is law, the city administrator's office is building the pipeline, and the neighborhood that fought hardest for relief is watching the clock with one eye open.

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

OAKLAND — The morning after the West Oakland Emergency Stabilization Fund cleared the council on a 6-3 vote, Denise Washington stood in the parking lot of the West Oakland Neighbors Association office on Peralta Street and fielded calls for three hours straight. Displaced tenants. Single mothers with temporary housing vouchers expiring in August. A retired longshoreman who'd been couch-surfing since March after his building on Filbert Street was condemned.

"Every one of them asked the same question," Washington said. "'When does the money come?'"

The answer, according to Councilmember Denise Carter, who sponsored the measure and shepherded it through four months of committee hearings, public testimony, and backroom negotiation, is forty-five days from the vote — putting the first disbursements on or around August 11.

But between the council chamber and a rent check, there is a city bureaucracy that has never administered an emergency housing fund of this scale. The $28 million reserve draw — the largest emergency intervention in Oakland's modern budget history — now sits with City Administrator Pauline Ochoa's office, which must design the application process, establish eligibility criteria, set disbursement amounts, and stand up a distribution mechanism, all before mid-August.

Carter's office released a preliminary framework this week. The fund will operate through three channels: direct emergency rental assistance for households facing displacement, bridge funding for community organizations providing transitional housing, and infrastructure grants for shelters and temporary housing facilities in West Oakland. The split, according to Carter's staff, is roughly sixty percent to direct household assistance, twenty-five percent to organizational bridge funding, and fifteen percent to infrastructure.

"We didn't pass this to create another study," Carter told the Bay Tribune on Monday. "The city administrator has clear instructions. Forty-five days is not a suggestion — it's a deadline."

Ochoa's office declined to comment on whether the timeline is achievable, citing ongoing internal planning. A spokesperson said the office expects to release a public implementation plan "within two weeks."

On 7th Street, the mood is layered.

At Esther's Coffeehouse near the West Oakland BART station, Gloria Meeks, 64, a retired postal worker who has lived on Linden Street for thirty-one years, said the vote felt like vindication — but not victory.

"I've watched this neighborhood get hollowed out," Meeks said, stirring her coffee slowly. "My neighbor Dorothy left in April. She's in Antioch now. Her grandkids went to Prescott Elementary. She didn't want to leave. If this money had come six months ago, she'd still be here."

Meeks said she plans to apply for infrastructure funding through her church, Allen Temple West, which has been running an informal emergency shelter in its basement since January. "We've been doing this with donations and prayer. If the city can put real money behind it, we can do it right."

Two blocks away, at the corner of Market and 8th, Terrence Baldwin, 37, a warehouse supervisor at the Port of Oakland, was less optimistic. Baldwin, who lives in a two-bedroom apartment on Campbell Street with his wife and two children, said his rent has increased by $400 since last October. He attended two of the public hearings on the fund but left both early.

"I sat there and listened to council members talk about disbursement mechanisms and eligibility matrices," Baldwin said. "I don't need a mechanism. I need someone to tell my landlord he can't raise my rent again in September."

Baldwin's concern points to a tension the fund was not designed to resolve. The Stabilization Fund provides emergency relief — it does not include rent control provisions, tenant protection ordinances, or landlord accountability measures. Carter has acknowledged this publicly, calling the fund "triage, not treatment," echoing Washington's language from the vote night.

Marcus Wright, the 29-year-old server at Lake Chalet who told the Bay Tribune last week that he'd "believe it when I see the checks," said he hasn't changed his position. "I'm not against it," Wright said by phone Tuesday. "I'm just not celebrating until somebody deposits something."

Wright said he's been working double shifts to cover a security deposit on a new apartment in the Laurel District after being priced out of his studio on Adeline Street. "If the fund covers relocation costs, great. But I can't wait forty-five days. I've got to move by the fifteenth."

The speed question is not academic. Carter's office estimates that approximately 1,200 households in West Oakland meet the preliminary eligibility criteria — families with incomes below the area median who have experienced rent increases above fifteen percent in the past twelve months or who are facing active displacement. The fund's direct assistance channel would need to process roughly eighty applications per day to meet the forty-five-day window for first disbursements.

Yolanda Sifuentes, 41, a home health aide who lives on Pine Street near DeFremery Park, said she's cautiously hopeful but has been through municipal programs before. "I applied for emergency rental assistance during the pandemic," Sifuentes said. "It took four months to get approved and another six weeks after that to see the money. My landlord didn't wait."

Sifuentes said she has a folder on her kitchen table with every document she thinks she might need — pay stubs, lease agreement, her children's school enrollment forms, utility bills. "I'm ready," she said. "The question is whether they are."

Carter is expected to hold a community briefing at the West Oakland Senior Center on July 12 to walk residents through the application process once the city administrator's plan is released. Washington said WONA will co-host and provide translation services in Spanish and Cantonese.

"The vote was the hard part for the council," Washington said. "The hard part for us is just starting."

THE COALITION THAT CRACKED: CRANE'S CROSSOVER AND THE CRC'S UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

One week after Elliott Crane broke ranks to pass the Stabilization Fund, the Civic Reform Coalition has gone quiet. That silence is louder than any floor speech.

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Investigations

OAKLAND — In the seven days since Elliott Crane cast his vote from a hospital bed — remotely, with a broken leg, in defiance of his own coalition — the Civic Reform Coalition has said nothing.

Not a press release. Not a statement. Not a social media post. Warren Ashford, the CRC's most vocal member and the councilmember for District 7, declined a request for comment through his chief of staff on Monday. Nina Chen's office sent a one-line email: "Councilmember Chen has no statement at this time." Crane's office has not responded to three separate inquiries since June 28.

In Oakland politics, silence is never neutral. And the CRC's silence right now is the most consequential non-statement of the council term.

The arithmetic is simple. Before the Stabilization Fund vote, the CRC held a reliable three-member bloc — Crane, Ashford, and Chen — that could anchor opposition to any spending measure. Combined with one or two sympathetic independents, the coalition could block supermajority requirements and force compromises. That leverage depended entirely on internal unity.

Crane broke it.

What remains unclear is why. On the night of the vote, Crane offered no floor remarks. He appeared on screen, cast his vote, and his feed disconnected. His office had previously indicated he would publish a set of conditions — fiscal guardrails he wanted attached to the fund as the price of his support. Those conditions have not appeared.

"There are two possibilities," said Rebecca Thornton, a political science lecturer at Cal State East Bay who tracks Oakland council dynamics. "Either Crane negotiated something privately that we haven't seen yet, or he acted on conscience without preconditions. Both are significant, but they mean very different things for what comes next."

What comes next is a series of votes that will define the council's direction for the remainder of the term. The Temescal Community Health Center appropriation is expected to come before the council as soon as the next meeting. The Oakland Alternative Response Initiative — the most politically volatile measure on the horizon — is projected for a vote in approximately six weeks. The Baylight District final council vote follows shortly after.

In each case, the CRC's ability to mount opposition depends on its cohesion. If Crane has genuinely broken from the coalition's fiscal orthodoxy, Ashford and Chen become an isolated pair rather than a bloc. If Crane's crossover was situational — a one-time concession on an emergency measure — the coalition may reconstitute. But Crane hasn't said which it is, and his colleagues aren't filling the void.

There is another dimension to the silence. The Oakland Police Officers' Association, which has been running a sustained pressure campaign against progressive spending measures, had counted on the CRC to hold the line. OPOA organizer Frank Ramirez has been building town hall infrastructure in District 4 to target Council President Ramon Vega, who also crossed expected lines by voting yes. If the CRC is fracturing, OPOA's leverage calculations shift — and Ramirez may need to expand his campaign beyond Vega.

I spoke with two sources close to the CRC caucus, both of whom requested anonymity. One described the internal mood as "frozen — nobody wants to be the first to say it out loud." The other said Ashford was "furious" but had been advised by staff not to publicly criticize Crane while he recovers from his injury.

Crane's broken leg provides a convenient buffer. He is not expected to return to in-person council sessions for at least two more weeks. That means any reckoning — any caucus meeting, any public explanation — can be deferred. But the votes won't wait. If the Temescal Health Center comes up next meeting, Crane will likely still be voting remotely. And his vote will be watched more closely than any other on the dais.

The CRC was built on a premise: that Oakland's fiscal future required discipline, restraint, and resistance to what Ashford once called "compassion spending." That premise held for two years. Whether it survives the summer depends on a question only Elliott Crane can answer — and so far, he isn't talking.

TEMESCAL PREPARES FOR ITS TURN: HEALTH CENTER VOTE LOOMS AS NEIGHBORHOOD WEIGHS IN

The community health center appropriation heads to council next meeting. In District 7, residents are ready — but their councilmember may not be.

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

The proposed Temescal Community Health Center has been in planning documents for three years, in neighborhood conversations for longer, and on the council's formal calendar since April. Next meeting, it finally gets a vote.

The appropriation would fund construction and first-year operations of a full-service community health center on Telegraph Avenue near 46th Street, in the heart of Temescal. The facility would provide primary care, behavioral health services, dental care, and a community wellness program, serving an estimated 8,000 patients annually in a neighborhood that currently has no publicly funded health clinic within a twelve-block radius.

The measure requires a simple majority — five votes out of nine — and the Oakland Progressive Party caucus, which controls four seats, is expected to vote in favor unanimously. That means the measure needs one additional vote from the council's independents or the CRC.

Council President Ramon Vega and Councilmember Clarissa Dane are both considered likely yes votes based on past committee statements. Councilmember Leonard Tran has not indicated a position. The math suggests the measure passes. But in the current political climate, math is unstable.

The complicating factor is Warren Ashford. The proposed health center sits in District 7 — Ashford's district. Under ordinary circumstances, a councilmember would champion a major public health investment in his own neighborhood. But Ashford has been a consistent critic of new spending commitments, and his CRC colleagues voted against the Stabilization Fund last week. Ashford has not publicly endorsed or opposed the health center, and his office did not respond to a request for comment on his position.

"It would be remarkable if he voted against a health center in his own district," said Patricia Ogilvie, 58, a retired nurse who lives on Shafter Avenue and has been attending planning meetings for the facility since 2024. "But I've stopped predicting what the council will do."

Ogilvie said the neighborhood's need is straightforward. The nearest publicly funded clinic is the LifeLong Medical Group location on Alcatraz Avenue, which serves a catchment area stretching from North Oakland to Rockridge. Wait times for new patient appointments have stretched to six weeks. Behavioral health referrals take longer.

"I spent thirty years in emergency departments," Ogilvie said. "Half the patients I saw didn't need an ER. They needed a clinic that was open, nearby, and affordable. That's what this is."

Derek Huang, 33, a freelance graphic designer who rents a studio apartment on 51st Street, said the health center matters to him for a more immediate reason. "I don't have employer insurance," Huang said. "I've been on Covered California for two years. Finding a provider who takes it and has availability is a part-time job. A community health center that's five blocks from my apartment would change my life."

Huang said he's aware of the political dynamics but finds them frustrating. "This isn't ideological. People get sick. They need doctors. Build the clinic."

The Temescal Neighborhood Association has formally endorsed the project. The North Oakland Senior Coalition sent a letter of support to the council last month signed by 140 residents. Ashford's office acknowledged receipt of the letter but did not respond to its contents.

If the measure passes, construction would begin in early 2027 with a projected opening in late 2028. The facility would be operated by Alameda Health System under a memorandum of understanding currently in draft.

The vote is expected at the next regular council session.

OPOA TURNS UP THE HEAT: RAMIREZ TOWN HALL TAKES AIM AT VEGA IN DISTRICT 4

Police officers' association escalates pressure campaign with a public forum in the Fruitvale — weeks before the alternative response initiative reaches the council floor.

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

Frank Ramirez, the Oakland Police Officers' Association's lead organizer, is bringing his campaign directly to Council President Ramon Vega's doorstep.

The OPOA announced this week that Ramirez will hold a town hall at the Fruitvale Community Center on International Boulevard on July 15 — a public forum focused on what the association calls "public safety accountability" and what its critics call a pressure campaign against progressive policing alternatives.

The event is the latest escalation in a months-long effort by the OPOA to target Vega, whom the association has identified as the swing vote most likely to determine the fate of the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative. OARI, which would create a civilian-led crisis response program as an alternative to armed police dispatch for certain categories of calls, is expected to reach the council floor in approximately six weeks.

Vega's yes vote on the Stabilization Fund last week — cast against significant OPOA opposition — appears to have accelerated the campaign. Residents in the Fruitvale and Dimond neighborhoods have reported receiving mailers from the OPOA over the past two weeks warning that "your council president is choosing politics over policing." The mailers include Vega's office phone number and urge residents to call.

Vega's office has not responded publicly to the mailers or the town hall announcement. In a brief exchange with the Bay Tribune after last week's vote, Vega said only, "I represent District 4. I vote for District 4."

Ramirez, who has become the most visible face of the OPOA's political operation, has framed the town hall as a listening session rather than an opposition rally. "We want to hear from the people who call 911 and wait forty minutes for a response," Ramirez said in a statement. "We want to ask them whether they think the answer is fewer officers."

But the timing and location are unmistakably strategic. The Fruitvale Community Center is three blocks from Vega's district office. The town hall falls two weeks before the earliest projected date for the OARI vote. And the OPOA's framing — fewer officers — mischaracterizes the initiative, which does not propose reducing police staffing but rather routing specific non-violent, non-criminal calls to civilian responders.

Whether the pressure campaign shifts Vega's calculus remains to be seen. His Stabilization Fund vote suggests he is willing to absorb political cost. But OARI is a different question — one that touches public safety directly and where the OPOA's influence is historically strongest.

The town hall is open to the public. Doors open at 6:30 p.m.

BUSINESS TICKER — EDITION 79

By Jordan Velez | Bay Tribune Business

— Retail load: Moderate to elevated. Post-holiday spending steady; Stabilization Fund uncertainty dampening long-term retail commitments in West Oakland corridor.
— Economic influence: Slightly elevated. Political capital from the 6-3 vote driving foot traffic in civic-adjacent commercial zones. Uptown and Downtown see minor bumps.
— Trend: Summer tourism uptick on schedule. Fourth of July weekend spending robust at lakeside and Jack London venues. West Oakland retail cautious — owners awaiting implementation details before restocking or hiring.
— Top dining: Harvest & Smoke (Temescal) — wood-fired small plates, 90-minute weekend wait. Luz Cocina (Fruitvale) — Oaxacan-inflected tasting menu drawing Rockridge crossover traffic.
— Fast casual: Banh Shop (Lake Merritt) — Vietnamese sandwiches, strong lunch numbers, expanding catering.
— Nightlife volume: Moderate, trending upward. Summer energy plus Warriors trade buzz filling bars earlier in the evening. Piedmont Ave and Uptown leading.
— Active spots: Telegraph Ave (KONO), Jack London waterfront, Temescal commercial strip.

THE $28M QUESTION. The Stabilization Fund's passage sends $28 million in emergency reserve capital toward anti-displacement measures in West Oakland, but the business implications remain sharply unclear. The 45-day disbursement timeline means no money moves until mid-August at the earliest. In the interim, I spoke with four small business owners along 7th Street, and the consensus was cautious pragmatism. Two plan to hold off on summer hiring until they see how the fund's rent stabilization provisions affect their lease terms. One — a laundromat owner who asked not to be named — said her landlord has already called to "discuss the new landscape," which she interpreted as a preemptive rent conversation. The fund is designed to keep residents in place, but if commercial rents aren't addressed in the implementation framework, the storefronts that serve those residents may not survive the rescue. The city's Economic Development office has scheduled a small business briefing for July 15. Attendance will tell us a great deal.

OAKLAND LIGHTS UP: A FOURTH OF JULY THAT FEELS DIFFERENT THIS YEAR

After a bruising vote and a long spring, the city exhales into summer

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

The smoke from the Lake Merritt fireworks had barely cleared Saturday night when Dolores Rios, 63, a retired postal worker from Fruitvale, turned to her granddaughter and said something that stuck with me all weekend. "You smell that? That's what it smells like when a city decides to keep fighting."

She was talking about the Stabilization Fund, of course. Everyone is. But she was also talking about the grilled corn from the Fruitvale village stand, and the sulfur-sweet haze of Roman candles over the water, and the particular quality of an Oakland July evening — warm enough to stay out late, cool enough from the morning fog that the pavement doesn't punish you for it. She was talking about home.

This Fourth of July landed differently. The 6-3 vote on the West Oakland Stabilization Fund was barely seventy-two hours old, and you could feel the aftershock in every neighborhood barbecue and block party I visited. In West Oakland, along Mandela Parkway, residents had set up folding tables end to end for a potluck that stretched half a block. The mood was complicated — there was pride, there was wariness, there was potato salad. A hand-painted banner read "28 MILLION REASONS TO STAY." Underneath it, someone had added in marker: "We'll see."

Over in KONO, muralist Dante Reyes unveiled a new piece on the side of the old warehouse space at 27th and Telegraph — a ten-foot panel he'd been working on for the past two weeks. It shows hands in red, white, and blue, but they're not waving flags. They're building something — a house, a clinic, a table. "I wanted to paint what independence actually looks like around here," Reyes told me, paint still under his fingernails. "It's not fireworks. It's staying put." Sculptor Alma Vasquez, whose studio is just up the block, helped him source the reclaimed wood for the frame. The two have been quietly anchoring KONO's art corridor all year, and the mural already had a small crowd taking photos by Saturday afternoon.

At Lake Merritt, the scene was what it always is on the Fourth — Oakland's living room, packed wall to wall. But the strain was visible this year in ways it hasn't been before. The trash cans overflowed by six o'clock. The 57 bus line was standing-room chaos. A pickup basketball game near the boathouse had to share court space with a family who'd set up a full canopy and speakers. Raymond Soto, 41, a mechanic from the Lake Merritt area, watched it all from a bench with his two sons. "I love that people want to be here," he said. "But the parks department hasn't touched that bathroom in months. The clinics are backed up. You feel the weight of it."

Still — and I want to be clear about this — people were celebrating. Up in Piedmont Ave, rising rapper Theo Banks performed a short set at an informal block gathering outside Fenton's, drawing a crowd that spilled onto the sidewalk. He debuted a new track that sampled — of all things — the city council's roll call vote on the Stabilization Fund. The kids loved it. Their parents looked like they might cry.

The Warriors' Giannis trade hung over everything like a second sky. You couldn't walk ten feet without seeing a new jersey, a phone screen replaying highlights, a stranger's opinion offered without invitation. In Temescal, where Kato Rivers trains and local sports bars did brisk business all weekend, the trade felt less like sports news and more like civic weather — a shift in pressure, a reason to look up.

Oakland is not a city that does uncomplicated joy. It never has been. But standing at the lake Saturday night, watching the fireworks reflect off the water while a boombox played Too Short and someone's abuela clapped along, I thought about what Dolores Rios said. You can smell it when a city keeps fighting. It smells like summer. It smells like gunpowder and grilled meat and jasmine from someone's yard. It smells like here.

Happy Fourth, Oakland. Now the real work starts.

WARRIORS LAND GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO IN THREE-TEAM BLOCKBUSTER; GREEN ERA ENDS IN OAKLAND

Golden State sends Draymond Green, Moses Moody, and four first-round picks to complete franchise-altering deal with Milwaukee and Boston

By Reed Thompson | Bay Tribune Wire

The Golden State Warriors have acquired two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and center Jericho Sims from the Milwaukee Bucks in the most significant trade in franchise history since the Kevin Durant signing, the team confirmed last week.

The three-team deal sends forward Draymond Green to the Boston Celtics, while guard Moses Moody and four future first-round picks go to Milwaukee. Boston's contribution to the deal included guard Anfernee Simmons and a first-round pick, routed to Milwaukee as part of the Draymond Green acquisition.

Golden State sits at 28-24, a record that belies the trajectory. The Warriors have won 25 of their last 47 games after a sluggish start that had fans questioning whether the franchise's competitive window had closed. The Antetokounmpo acquisition answers that question definitively.

Antetokounmpo, 31, remains one of the most dominant two-way players in the league. His ability to guard multiple positions and finish at the rim at elite rates gives Golden State a paint presence they have not had since their dynasty years.

The cost was steep. Green, a four-time champion and the emotional backbone of the Warriors' title runs, leaves Oakland after more than a decade. The four first-round picks represent a significant portion of the franchise's draft capital through the mid-2040s. Moody, 24, was viewed internally as a long-term rotation piece.

Meanwhile, rumblings persist that the Warriors ownership group is aggressively pursuing Mike Paulson — currently the general manager of both the Oakland A's and the Chicago Bulls — for GM duties in Oakland. Paulson stated publicly that his immediate plans are to remain with the Bulls this season but noted there is no long-term agreement in Chicago. The Warriors declined to comment on the Paulson pursuit.

The trade is eligible to be finalized following the league's standard processing period. Antetokounmpo is expected to make his Warriors debut at Chase Center this week.

THE GREEK FREAK IN GOLD AND BLUE — AND OAKLAND ISN'T DONE YET

By P Slayer | Bay Tribune Sports Opinion

I sat at my desk for a full ten minutes after the trade broke, just staring at my phone. Giannis Antetokounmpo. In a Warriors jersey. Walking through the tunnel at Chase Center. I had to read it three times because my brain refused to accept it on the first two.

Oakland, do you understand what just happened?

This city has taken its lumps. We have watched teams leave, watched front offices penny-pinch, watched other markets throw money around while we scraped by on heart and homegrown talent. And now the Warriors go out and land one of the five best basketball players on the planet. Not through the draft. Not through some slow rebuild. They picked up the phone, made the call, and brought Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Bay.

Yes, it hurts to lose Draymond Green. I will not pretend otherwise. That man was the heartbeat of a dynasty. He was the scream after every stop, the guy who made winning contagious. Four rings. The memories do not go away because the jersey changes. But dynasties evolve or they die. Golden State chose to evolve.

And the way this team has been playing — 25 wins in the last 47 after looking like a lottery team early — tells you the locker room was already shifting. They were already finding something. Now you drop Giannis into the middle of it? The Chase Center crowd is going to lose its collective mind. I cannot wait to hear that building when he throws down his first dunk in gold and blue.

But here is the part that really gets me. The Paulson angle. The Warriors are not just trading for a superstar. They are reportedly going after Mike Paulson to run the entire basketball operation. The same Paulson who built the A's into a six-time championship dynasty. The same Paulson who has the Bulls sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference. If Golden State lands both Giannis and Paulson, you are looking at a franchise that is not chasing a single title — they are building a machine.

And what does that say about Oakland as a sports city? The A's are coming off 105 wins. The Warriors just made the biggest trade of the decade. There is a gravitational pull here. Players want to be here. Front office minds want to be here. Oakland is not some afterthought market anymore. This city is a destination.

I know the skeptics will point to the four first-round picks headed to Milwaukee. I know the cap implications are complicated. I know Draymond in green — Celtics green, not Warriors green — is going to sting for a while. But when you can get a player like Giannis, you make the deal. You figure the rest out later.

This is the kind of move that changes the energy of a whole city. Walk down Broadway right now. Go sit in a bar in Jack London Square. People are talking about this trade the way they talk about championship parades. The possibility is back. The belief is back.

Giannis Antetokounmpo is a Golden State Warrior.

Oakland, it is good to be us right now.

A'S 2041 SPRING TRAINING PREVIEW: A RETOOLED ROSTER, A FAREWELL SEASON, AND QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERS

Paulson's off-season haul reshapes Oakland's championship window as Keane prepares for his final ride

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

The Oakland A's will report to spring training with a roster that looks meaningfully different from the one that won 105 games last season and pushed Boston to seven games in the ALCS. Whether it is better is the question Mike Paulson is betting his legacy on.

Start with the headliner. Travis Coles is 21 years old, throws 97 with a wipeout slider, and posted a 2.05 ERA with 207 strikeouts for Washington last season. He is, on paper, exactly the kind of arm you mortgage the future for. And Paulson did mortgage: George Whiteley, Agustin Rodriguez, Cy Newell, and Peter Busch — four prospects, three of whom had top-100 helium — all went to Washington. If Coles becomes the ace this rotation needs behind Arturo Ramos, nobody will remember the names. If he doesn't, every single one of them will haunt this front office.

Coles slots into a projected rotation of Henry Rivas, Ramos, Coles, John Ellis, and Benji Dillon. That is a group with an interesting mix of experience and youth. Dillon, 38, re-signed on a one-year, $13 million deal after the front office reportedly considered letting him walk. He chose Oakland. That decision carries weight in a clubhouse.

At second base, Eric Tavares arrives on a seven-year, $32.1 million annual commitment. The numbers demand scrutiny. Tavares hit .237 last season with 31 home runs and 92 RBI. That is legitimate power from the middle infield. That is also a batting average that will test Oakland's patience. At 25, the A's are betting on development, on the idea that Tavares' raw tools have room to refine. Seven years is a long time to be wrong.

Mariano Rosales, 26, comes from Baltimore to close games. Thirty-eight saves. Edmundo Pena, a franchise fixture, was part of the return package heading to the Orioles. That trade stung in the clubhouse, according to multiple sources. Pena was respected. Rosales will need to earn his standing.

Then there is the farewell. Vinnie Keane has confirmed that 2041 is his final season. Thirty-six years old, six rings, the most decorated player in modern A's history. Every at-bat this year carries the weight of goodbye. The organization has not announced any formal celebration plans, but expect Oakland to honor what Keane has meant to this franchise and this city throughout the season.

Darrin Davis, who missed significant time with his injury, is reportedly feeling near 100 percent and is on track for full spring training participation. His return gives Paulson another proven bat in a lineup that needs every one.

And watch Ernesto Quintero. The 22-year-old third baseman is the number three prospect in all of baseball. He has the swing, the glove, and the composure. With Mark Aitken entrenched at third, Quintero's path to everyday at-bats is not yet clear, but Paulson has hinted at creative lineup solutions. If Quintero hits the way evaluators believe he can, you find a way to get him 500 plate appearances.

The elephant in the spring training facility is Deacon Seymour. The first-year manager has no prior managerial experience. An anonymous rival GM was quoted saying that "Paulson hiring Deacon will be his A's undoing." Seymour has already navigated one personnel issue — a strength and conditioning coach was let go following an unspecified incident at the practice facility — and dealt with public criticism from Jeremy McCracken, who was traded less than two weeks after acquisition and was openly critical of how the front office handled his time in Oakland.

Seymour does not need to be perfect. But he needs to manage a clubhouse with a retiring legend, a returning veteran, a crop of expensive newcomers, and the pressure of a 105-win predecessor season. That is a tall order for a manager with a long track record. For a first-timer, it is a proving ground.

The A's lost the ALCS to Boston in seven games last October. That taste does not wash out. This off-season was designed to get them past that moment. Spring training will tell us whether the pieces fit or whether Paulson is trying to force a puzzle together with parts from different boxes.

FROM THE DIAMOND TO THE COUNCIL FLOOR: AITKEN SHOWS UP WHERE BALLPLAYERS RARELY DO

A's third baseman and newly named MLBPA representative attended West Oakland Stabilization Fund vote, extending his quiet influence on the Baylight District push

By Hal Richmond | Bay Tribune Sports

Mark Aitken was not at a batting cage last week. He was not running winter drills or sitting in a film room. The Oakland A's third baseman was in the gallery at the West Oakland Stabilization Fund floor vote, watching city governance happen in real time.

It is not the kind of place you expect to find a major league ballplayer during the off-season. Aitken did not speak publicly at the hearing. He did not grandstand. He sat, he listened, and his presence was noted by multiple council observers and community members in attendance. In a city where professional athletes often exist in a separate orbit from civic life, Aitken continues to close that distance.

This is not new territory for him. Aitken was a significant behind-the-scenes influence during the Baylight District negotiations, a complex development process that has reshaped conversations about housing, commerce, and community investment along the waterfront. His involvement in those discussions was substantive, not performative — sources close to the negotiations say Aitken engaged directly with planning details and community stakeholder concerns.

His appointment as MLBPA association representative adds a formal layer to what has been an informal civic role. The position gives Aitken a voice in league-wide labor discussions, but in Oakland it signals something broader. Here is a player who sees his connection to the city as extending beyond the diamond, beyond the contract, beyond the season.

The question worth asking is whether this kind of engagement becomes contagious. The A's have built a roster full of established veterans and high-profile newcomers, many of whom will call Oakland home for years. Aitken is modeling what it looks like when a player invests in the place where he plays — not with a charity check and a photo opportunity, but with his time and his attention in rooms where decisions get made.

It is worth noting that Mike Paulson, who oversees A's operations, had no reported presence at either the Stabilization Fund vote or the Baylight hearing. That absence is not necessarily meaningful. Paulson is managing two franchises across two time zones and is reportedly being courted by the Warriors for a third role. His plate is full. But the contrast exists. Aitken showed up. The front office did not.

Oakland has always been a city that respects people who show up. Mark Aitken keeps showing up.

CHICAGO SPORTS

THE BULLS AREN'T BUILDING ANYMORE — THEY'RE LOADING

Holiday brings a ring. Simmons brings a question mark. At 37-15, Chicago is betting on both.

By Selena Grant | Skyline Tribune Sports

CHICAGO — Let's be precise about what happened at the trade deadline: Mike Paulson looked at the best roster in the Eastern Conference and decided it wasn't enough. That's not tinkering. That's a general manager who sees a championship window and is throwing it wide open.

The Jrue Holiday acquisition is the kind of move that separates front offices that talk about contending from front offices that actually contend. Holiday, 34, is a proven winner — a two-way guard who has been the defensive anchor on a championship team, a player who doesn't need the ball to impact a game but can run an offense when you hand it to him. The cost was Tre Jones and a second-round pick. For a player of Holiday's caliber, that's not a gamble. That's a steal.

What Holiday does for this roster is straightforward: he gives Josh Giddey a partner in the backcourt who can guard the opponent's best perimeter player, freeing Giddey to operate as a pure playmaker — a role in which he has been historic this season. Giddey's 23-assist performance against the Lakers, the second-highest single-game total in franchise history behind Guy Rodgers' 24 in 1966, wasn't an aberration. It was a preview of what happens when you surround a generational passer with players who can finish. Holiday is one of the best cutters and off-ball movers in the league. The Giddey-Holiday pick-and-roll combinations alone should terrify defensive coordinators from Milwaukee to Boston.

Then there's Ben Simmons.

I'll say this plainly: I understand the skepticism. Simmons has been one of the most frustrating talents in the NBA for years — a player whose physical gifts suggest a perennial All-Star, whose actual output has been maddeningly inconsistent and derailed by well-documented personal and professional struggles. Signing him for the remainder of the season is not the same as betting the franchise on him. It's a calculated, low-cost addition with enormous upside. If Simmons gives this team even seventy percent of his peak ability as a point-forward off the bench, he becomes a switchable defender and secondary ball-handler who can spell Giddey and Holiday without the offense collapsing. If he doesn't work out, you move on. The risk is minimal. The ceiling is tantalizing.

The larger question is how these pieces fit alongside the players who built this 37-15 record in the first place — and the answer, frankly, is beautifully.

Hank Trepagnier continues to be the most dominant rookie in the NBA. His season averages — 16.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 5.4 assists — put him firmly at the front of the Rookie of the Year race, and nothing that happened at the deadline changes his role. Trepagnier is this team's fulcrum: the center who can pass, shoot, and protect the rim. His 23-point, 8-assist destruction of Indiana was the latest in a season-long series of performances that suggest Chicago has drafted a franchise cornerstone. Holiday and Simmons don't compete with Trepagnier for touches. They complement him.

Adash Stanley, the rookie guard who has quietly positioned himself fifth in both the Rookie of the Year and Sixth Man of the Year conversations at 11.5 points and 4.1 assists per game, may actually benefit the most from the new arrivals. With Holiday absorbing some of the starting backcourt minutes, Stanley can operate as an even more explosive spark off the bench — a role in which he has thrived, as evidenced by his 26-point outburst against the Lakers, punctuated by a crossover on Luka Doncic that became the most replayed highlight of the week.

On the injury front, there's encouraging news. Matas Buzelis, who has been sidelined with a pinched nerve in his back, is approaching his return window. Buzelis was in the thick of the Most Improved Player conversation before the injury — 13.8 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, a leap that validated every bit of Paulson's faith in his development. Similarly, Kevin Huerter, out since October with a strained right hip, should be rejoining the rotation imminently. Getting those two back is the equivalent of another trade deadline acquisition, and it gives Paulson's bench a depth that no other team in the East can match.

Now, about the elephant in the room — or more accurately, the Greek Freak in the Bay.

The Bulls reportedly had Giannis Antetokounmpo on their wish list. The Golden State Warriors landed him instead. That stings. There's no way around it. Adding Giannis to a core of Giddey, Trepagnier, and Holiday would have made Chicago the prohibitive title favorite. Instead, the Warriors now possess the most talented roster in the Western Conference, perhaps in the entire league, and they're pursuing the very general manager who built what Chicago has.

But here's what I keep coming back to: the Bulls are 37-15 without Giannis. They are NBA Cup champions. They have the likely Rookie of the Year, a point guard putting up historic assist numbers, and a newly fortified backcourt. The Giannis miss hurts, but it doesn't break anything. Paulson built this team with depth and versatility, not dependency on a single superstar. That philosophy just got reinforced at the deadline.

At 37-15, Chicago owns the best record in the East and arguably the best start in franchise history under Paulson's stewardship. The rebuild that began with the bold Vucevic trade — the accumulation of draft capital, the patient development of young players — has produced something rare: a team that is simultaneously young and ready to win right now.

The trade deadline confirmed it. The Bulls aren't building anymore. They're loading.

CHICAGO GROUND

HE KEEPS BUILDING A HOUSE HE SAYS HE MIGHT NOT LIVE IN

Paulson's "no long-term agreement" leaves Chicago uneasy — even as the city falls harder for the team he made.

By Talia Finch | Skyline Tribune

CHICAGO — The coffee at Romano's on 35th Cafe Revival was the same as always on Wednesday morning — dark roast, no nonsense, served in ceramic mugs that have survived more Chicago summers than most marriages. What wasn't the same was the conversation.

"Did you see the Holiday trade?" said a woman two tables over, not to anyone in particular. Just to the room.

The room answered.

That's how it goes in Bridgeport right now. The Bulls are a communal nervous system, and every transaction sends a pulse through the neighborhood. Sofia Romano's cafe, tucked into a block of 35th Street where the awnings shade the sidewalk and the ceiling fan clicks overhead, has become one of the unofficial nerve centers. It helps that the cafe sits in the neighborhood where Mike Paulson grew up — South Side, Bridgeport born, one of three brothers who used to shoot around at the park on Lowe Avenue. The Shannon-Romano families still talk about him like he's local, because he is. Or was. Or might still be. That's the part nobody can quite pin down.

Paulson's social media post from last week — "immediate plans are to be with the Bulls this season" but "no long-term agreement in Chicago" — landed in this city like a weather forecast nobody wanted to read. Fourteen words that managed to be both reassuring and devastating at the same time.

"He just got us Jrue Holiday," said DeAndre Mitchell, 31, a paralegal from Bronzeville who stops at Romano's before his commute. He was holding his phone, the trade notification still on screen like he was afraid it would disappear if he swiped away. "He signed Simmons. You don't make those moves if you're leaving. You just don't."

He paused.

"Right?"

That pause is the mood in Chicago right now. The Bulls are 37-15. They're NBA Cup champions. Hank Trepagnier is playing basketball that makes grown men stand up from their couches. Josh Giddey is throwing passes that belong in a museum. And Mike Paulson — the man who dismantled a mediocre roster and rebuilt it into the best team in the Eastern Conference — keeps making moves that suggest a man fully invested in this franchise's future while simultaneously telling everyone, in his own careful words, that he hasn't committed to being part of it.

The Golden State Warriors are pursuing him. That fact hangs over every celebration, every highlight, every trade analysis. The Warriors, who just landed Giannis Antetokounmpo — a player the Bulls reportedly wanted — now want the architect too. If Oakland gets Paulson, it gets the mind that built this. Chicago keeps the roster, sure. But rosters without vision have a shelf life, and everyone in this city knows it.

"I'm trying not to think about it," said Carmen Olivares, 44, a nurse from Pilsen who watches every Bulls game with her two sons. She was standing outside the cafe, sunglasses pushed up on her forehead in the midday heat. "My boys finally have a team they're proud of. Like, actually proud. Not just hopeful — proud. If he leaves..." She trailed off, shook her head. "I just think he owes it to the city to stay. He's from here."

That's the thing about Paulson's Bridgeport roots — they cut both ways. The neighborhood claims him, which means the neighborhood feels entitled to him. The fact that he grew up on these blocks, that the Shannon-Romano families still consider him one of their own — it all creates a gravitational pull that Paulson himself has acknowledged. But gravity isn't a contract. And "no long-term agreement" is the kind of phrase that keeps people up at night, replaying it, searching for hidden meaning that probably isn't there.

Meanwhile, the city falls deeper in love with what he built. The Holiday trade electrified a fan base that was already running hot. The Simmons signing divided opinion — "genius or insanity, no middle ground," as one bartender on Halsted put it — but even the skeptics admit it's the kind of bold, low-risk swing that defines Paulson's approach. He doesn't build cautiously. He builds like a man who believes in what he's doing.

Which makes the ambiguity that much harder to stomach.

On Wednesday morning at Romano's, the ceiling fan clicked. The coffee steamed. Outside, Bridgeport sat under a hazy summer sky, the kind of July glare that makes the whole city look like it's holding its breath.

It is.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

Dear Editor,

I have lived on Peralta Street in West Oakland for thirty-one years. I raised my son here. I buried my mother from this house. So when people ask me how I feel about the Stabilization Fund, I want to be honest: I feel tired.

I am glad the vote passed. I am. Six to three, late at night, the way everything happens in this city — at the last minute, when half the people affected are already asleep because they have to work in the morning. But I have watched promises come through this neighborhood like weather. The money sounds real. Twenty-eight million dollars sounds like a lot. But I have seen real money evaporate before it reaches the people who need it. I have seen committees and advisory boards and implementation frameworks, and at the end of it all, my neighbor Gloria still lost her apartment on 28th Street last March.

So I will say this: I am hopeful. But I am not relaxed. Forty-five days to first disbursements means forty-five days for someone to find a loophole. I will be watching. We all will.

— Carla Edmonds, 58, West Oakland

Dear Editor,

My daughter has asthma. She is nine. We go to the Temescal clinic twice a month, sometimes more when the air is bad. The vote on expanding that clinic is coming up, and I need people to understand what it means for families like mine.

Right now, we wait two hours on a good day. The nurses are wonderful but they are stretched to breaking. Last month a receptionist told me, apologetically, that they had lost two staff members in three weeks. My daughter sat in a plastic chair reading the same torn magazine for an hour and forty minutes. She is nine. She should not have to be that patient.

The expansion would add capacity, extend hours, and bring in a pediatric specialist two days a week. For us, that is not a policy debate. That is whether my daughter can breathe. I am asking everyone in Temescal and beyond to pay attention to this vote. Show up. Call your councilmember. This is not abstract. This is a child with an inhaler in a waiting room.

— Nina Wellsley, 34, Temescal

Dear Editor,

I am going to say what every single person on the 57 bus is thinking: GIANNIS. IN A WARRIORS JERSEY. IN OAKLAND.

I don't care that they play in San Francisco now. The Warriors are Oakland's team. They will always be Oakland's team. And bringing Giannis Antetokounmpo here — to the Bay, to this roster, to this moment — feels like the universe finally paying us back for something.

I watched the trade news break at my buddy's shop in Temescal and I am not exaggerating when I say a grown man cried. Not me. But a grown man. I'm not going to pretend this fixes the potholes or the rent or any of the real stuff this paper covers every week. But sometimes a city needs something to feel good about that doesn't come with a 45-day implementation timeline. Sometimes you just need to imagine Giannis throwing down a dunk and know that the jersey says Golden State and the heart says Oakland.

Championship or bust. I said what I said.

— DeShawn Harris, 29, Temescal

Dear Editor,

I moved to Lake Merritt four years ago because I fell in love with the lake. The egrets in the morning. The joggers. The drummers on Sunday. It was the most alive place I had ever seen.

It is still alive. But it is groaning.

I do not blame anyone for wanting to be here. That is the problem — this neighborhood is so good that everyone came, and now the thing that made it good is buckling. The clinic on East 18th has a three-week wait for a basic appointment. I watched a mother with a stroller try to board the 12 bus last Tuesday and get turned away because there was literally no room. The grass around the lake is worn to dirt in patches because parks maintenance cannot keep up.

I am not writing to complain about newcomers. I was a newcomer. I am writing to ask the city to fund the infrastructure that keeps this neighborhood livable. If the Stabilization Fund can send $28 million to West Oakland — and it should — then surely someone at City Hall can find the budget to fix a bathroom at Lake Merritt and add a bus to the 12 line. We are not asking for a miracle. We are asking for maintenance.

— Sandra Yee, 37, Lake Merritt
