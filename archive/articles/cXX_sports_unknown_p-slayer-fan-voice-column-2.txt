P SLAYER — Fan Voice Column
“They Broke Up the Band and Told Us It’s an Upgrade”
I don’t know how to process this offseason, so I’m just going to scream into the void and hope someone hears me.
CY NEWELL IS GONE.
The kid who saved our season when Allen Lopez fell apart. The kid who went 3-1 with a 2.95 ERA as a mid-season call-up. The kid who pitched 6 innings with 5 strikeouts in ALCS Game 5 when we were fighting for our lives.
Gone. Traded for Travis Coles, who is great, yes, but CY NEWELL SAVED US.
AGUSTIN RODRIGUEZ IS GONE.
Had a career year. Hit a 3-run homer in ALDS Game 1 when we were trying not to choke. Played his heart out.
Gone. For Travis Coles.
PETER BUSCH IS GONE.
Homered twice in ALDS Game 3. Homered twice in ALCS Game 6 when we needed  complete game shutout from Henry Rivas just to stay alive.
Gone. For Travis Coles.
EDMUNDO PEÑA IS GONE.
Five-time All-Star. OUR CLOSER. Forty-two saves last year. The guy who shut the door for a decade.
Gone. For a 26-year-old with five blown saves.
BENJI DILLON ISN’T COMING BACK.
Finished 2nd in Cy Young voting. Came back to Oakland on a one-year deal to give us one more shot. Pitched a shutout in ALCS Game 4 to keep us alive.
We replaced him with a 33-year-old who went 9-14.
ANTONIO CASTRO IS GONE.
Had a career year. We traded him for the 9-14 guy.
I don’t understand the plan. Anthony can give you the WAR projections and efficiency metrics. I can only tell you this feels like watching your family get traded away one piece at a time while someone tells you it’s an “organizational philosophy shift.”
We went 105-57. We took Boston to seven games. We were RIGHT THERE.
And instead of running it back with the core that got us there, we’re betting on a 21-year-old ace, a .237-hitting second baseman on a SEVEN-YEAR CONTRACT, and a manager who’s never managed a game.
Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe Coles becomes the next Benji Dillon. Maybe Tavares becomes the next Isley Kelley. Maybe Deacon Seymour is a tactical genius.
Or maybe Mike Paulson is in Chicago eating dinner with basketball players while Oakland burns.
I miss Cy. I miss Agustin’s clutch gene. I miss Busch’s playoff power. I miss Peña’s dominance. I miss believing we knew what we were doing.
2041 starts in spring. I’ll be there Opening Day. I’ll wear my Kelley jersey. I’ll cheer for Coles and Tavares and this team that looks nothing like the team I loved.
But I won’t pretend this doesn’t hurt.
