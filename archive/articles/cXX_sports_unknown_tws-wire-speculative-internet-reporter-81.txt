SOURCE: OWNERSHIP GROUP QUIETLY ASSEMBLING OAKLAND NBA BID

OAKLAND — Multiple league-connected sources tell TWS Wire that a private ownership consortium has been quietly assembling financing for what insiders describe as a “serious but discreet” NBA expansion pitch tied directly to the Baylight District arena proposal.

No official filing has been submitted to the NBA league office. No public announcement has been made. But three separate sources — one connected to arena financing, one tied to West Coast sports investment circles, and one municipal consultant familiar with waterfront development discussions — confirm that exploratory conversations are underway.

The group is said to include:
	•	A Bay Area tech investor with prior minority stakes in professional sports
	•	A former athlete with ties to Oakland’s previous NBA era
	•	At least one national media capital partner

An expansion fee north of $3 billion is expected should the league move beyond 30 teams. Las Vegas and Seattle remain widely regarded as frontrunners. Oakland, according to one league executive who requested anonymity, is “not out of the picture, but not guaranteed a seat.”

The Baylight District’s proposed privately financed arena is believed to be the centerpiece of the pitch. Unlike previous stadium disputes in the city, sources emphasize the current proposal would avoid public bond exposure.

“This isn’t nostalgia-driven,” one financial advisor familiar with the group said. “This is market math.”

However, league insiders caution that no expansion timeline has been finalized. Commissioner-level discussions are reportedly focused first on broadcast-right valuations and collective bargaining implications before formal expansion votes.

Within City Hall, two council staffers privately acknowledged hearing “rumblings,” though no formal proposal has reached public review channels.

Community sentiment remains mixed.

“I’d love a team back,” said Marcus Bell, 41, a longtime resident of East Oakland. “But not if it’s another taxpayer story.”

Meanwhile, hospitality operators near the waterfront have quietly begun modeling projected game-night revenue scenarios tied to Baylight’s retail zoning.

One source described the process this way:

“It’s exploratory, but it’s not fantasy.”

League representatives declined to comment. Baylight Development Group issued a brief statement saying it “continues to evaluate multi-use entertainment partnerships.”

For now, it remains rumor.

But it is no longer just talk.
