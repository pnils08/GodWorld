WEST OAKLAND STABILIZATION FUND CLEARS COUNCIL IN TENSE LATE-NIGHT VOTE

Tran's surprise YES delivers 6-3 supermajority; $28M reserve draw greenlit over CRC opposition

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

OAKLAND — The West Oakland Emergency Stabilization Fund survived a bruising floor fight late Thursday night, passing 6-3 in a vote that wasn't certain until Council President Ramon Vega called the roll and District 2 Councilmember Leonard Tran, the chamber's most reluctant voice, said yes.

The $28 million reserve draw — the largest single emergency intervention in Oakland's modern budget history — needed exactly six votes to clear the supermajority threshold for reserve fund access. It got exactly six.

District 1 Councilmember Denise Carter, the fund's primary sponsor, sat motionless at the dais as the final tally was read aloud at 11:47 p.m. She did not smile. She pressed both palms flat on the desk in front of her, exhaled, and said only: "We have work to do."

The vote split along familiar lines — and one unfamiliar one. The Civic Renewal Coalition bloc held firm in opposition: Elliott Crane of District 6, participating remotely after breaking his leg; Warren Ashford of District 7; and Nina Chen of District 8 all voted no. The progressive-opposition coalition delivered its four expected votes from Carter, Rose Delgado of District 3, Janae Rivers of District 5, and Terrence Mobley of District 9.

That left two. Everyone in the chamber knew the math.

Vega, the District 4 independent who serves as Council President, had been the target of a sustained pressure campaign from the Oakland Police Officers Association, which blanketed his district with mailers warning that the reserve draw would gut the city's fiscal cushion. He voted yes anyway, without comment beyond the word itself.

But it was Tran who drew the sharpest breath from the gallery. The District 2 independent had been genuinely undecided through weeks of committee hearings and had told reporters as recently as Tuesday that he was "still working through the numbers." When Vega called his name, the chamber went quiet. A beat passed. Tran leaned into his microphone.

"Yes," he said. "With serious reservations."

He did not elaborate.

'Three families on my block'

The vote capped a legislative fight that had consumed the council for two full cycles and drawn some of the most pointed public testimony Oakland City Hall has heard in years.

Javier Harris, 57, a West Oakland electrician who testified before the council last cycle, was in the gallery Thursday. It was Harris who had told the council that three families on his block — 1847 Filbert, 1852 Filbert, 1859 Filbert — were gone, and that the neighbors who stayed were watching this vote. Reached after the vote, he was subdued.

"I'm glad they did the right thing," Harris said. "I'm not going to celebrate. Those families needed this months ago."

Denise Washington, 52, executive director of the West Oakland Neighborhood Association, had framed the fund during earlier testimony as "triage, not a cure." She held to that line Thursday night.

"Triage is what you do when people are bleeding," Washington said. "Nobody throws a party after triage. You stabilize the patient and then you figure out what went wrong."

Opposition digs in

The CRC bloc argued the reserve draw sets a dangerous fiscal precedent. Ashford, speaking from the dais shortly before the vote, called the fund "a $28 million blank check drawn on the city's emergency savings with no structural reform attached." Chen echoed the concern, noting that Oakland's reserves would drop below the 15 percent target recommended by the city's own financial policies.

Crane, his voice slightly distorted over the remote connection, was blunter: "We are spending down our safety net to build a safety net. Someone explain that math to me."

Gerald Hoffman, 61, president of the Oakland Taxpayers Coalition and a consistent opponent of the fund, watched from the second row of the gallery. He shook his head slowly as the vote was read.

"Six votes doesn't make it sound policy," Hoffman said. "It makes it legal. Those are different things."

Skeptics watching

Not everyone in West Oakland is ready to trust the result.

Marcus Wright, 29, a server who was recently promoted to Tier 3 priority status under the fund's displacement-risk framework, has been openly skeptical of the program since it was first proposed. Last cycle he told the Tribune he'd "believe it when I see the checks."

Thursday night, standing outside City Hall in the overcast dark, Wright was only slightly more generous.

"They passed it. Good," Wright said. "Now I want to see a dollar amount with my name on it. Not a press release. Not a framework. A check."

The fund will now move to the city administrator's office for implementation planning. Carter said she expects the first disbursements within 45 days, targeted at households facing imminent displacement in West Oakland's hardest-hit census tracts.

Progressive Caucus Leader Janae Rivers of District 5, who helped whip votes for the fund, lingered in the hallway after adjournment. She declined to characterize the vote as a victory.

"A victory is when people stay in their homes," Rivers said. "Tonight we bought time. That's all. Time."

The council chamber was empty by 12:30 a.m. The overhead lights clicked off in sections. Outside, the temperature had dropped to 58 degrees, and a light mist hung over Frank Ogawa Plaza.

LAKE MERRITT BUCKLES UNDER INFLOW PRESSURE AS CIVIC LOAD HITS STRAIN THRESHOLD

Population surge drives tension score to 6.32; services stretched across the lake's east shore

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

OAKLAND — The same city that spent years worrying about people leaving is now contending with what happens when they arrive.

A surge of population inflow around Lake Merritt has pushed neighborhood tension to 6.32 — the highest single-arc reading recorded this cycle — as new residents collide with infrastructure that was built for a smaller, quieter district. City monitors flagged a high-severity civic event at the lake this week, estimating an impact level of 6 across a population of roughly 300 residents in the immediate affected zone.

The strains are prosaic and relentless: longer waits at the Lake Merritt clinic, standing-room conditions on the 12th Street corridor AC Transit lines during peak hours, and a parks maintenance backlog that has left the eastern lakeshore path buckled in three places since November.

Vanessa Thompson, 42, a barista who moved to a Lake Merritt apartment two years ago, said the neighborhood she chose for its walkability is becoming harder to navigate on foot.

"I picked this neighborhood because it felt livable," Thompson said. "Now I can't get a same-week appointment at the clinic and the bus just passes me sometimes because it's full. I'm not complaining about Oakland. I'm saying the pipes are too small for the water."

The inflow strain represents a demographic inversion that city planners have been slow to acknowledge. For most of the past decade, Oakland's dominant population story was outflow — displacement, rising costs, the steady drip of residents relocating to Antioch, Stockton, and Sacramento. The Stabilization Fund that passed council Thursday night was designed to address exactly that crisis.

But migration is a wheel, not a line. Federal infrastructure spending, the expansion of the Port logistics corridor, and Oakland's relative affordability compared to San Francisco have drawn new residents into neighborhoods that were already running lean on services. Lake Merritt, with its transit access and dense housing stock, has absorbed a disproportionate share.

Load-strain across the city

The inflow pressure at the lake is the sharpest expression of a broader trend. The city's civic load reading has been elevated to "load-strain" status this cycle, with 47 elected and appointed officials tracked across 27 distinct world events — a density of governance demand that city operations staff describe as unsustainable without additional hiring.

That hiring is further complicated by the continued absence of Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei, who oversees economic development and has been in serious condition since a car accident. Osei's portfolio, which includes workforce coordination and small-business permitting, has been distributed across three deputy-level staff members, none of whom have his institutional relationships with the Port Authority or the Building Trades Council.

Councilmember Elliott Crane of District 6, himself participating remotely this cycle after breaking his leg, noted the irony during Thursday's session: "We have a civic apparatus that is physically breaking down at the same time the people who run it are physically breaking down."

On the ground at the lake

Devon Walker, 22, a server who lives in Adams Point on the lake's northwest edge, said the strain is visible in daily rhythms that don't make headlines.

"The coffee shop where I pick up my morning order has a line to the door now. That didn't happen a year ago," Walker said. "The park is packed on weekends. The trash cans overflow by noon. It's not a crisis, it's just — everything is a little bit harder than it was."

Yuki Jackson, 48, a bartender who has lived in a Lake Merritt apartment for four years, offered a longer view.

"I've watched this neighborhood go from half-empty to bursting," Jackson said. "I'm happy people want to live here. But the city needs to catch up. The sewers are the same sewers. The bus routes are the same bus routes. You can't just add people and not add capacity."

City officials have not yet announced a specific response to the Lake Merritt inflow pressure. The civic load-strain designation triggers an internal review process, but that process is itself subject to the staffing constraints it is meant to address.

Citywide sentiment has dropped to 0.54, down sharply from 0.75 last cycle — a decline that tracks with the overcast, 60-degree Thursday that blanketed the council's late-night Stabilization Fund vote and the quieter, less dramatic erosion of daily life around the lake.

The forecast for the weekend is more of the same: gray skies, cool temperatures, and a city trying to hold together in two directions at once.

THE QUIET WEEK: 22 ACTS OF FAITH ACROSS OAKLAND

By Elliot Graye | Community Affairs

The overcast sky above Piedmont Avenue on Tuesday evening matched the mood inside Beth Jacob Congregation, where roughly forty people sat in a loose circle of folding chairs, some holding hands, others holding nothing at all. Rabbi Miriam Adler had placed a single candle at the center of the room. The grief gathering — organized for families affected by displacement and loss — required no agenda. People spoke when they were ready.

"You don't realize how much you need a room like that until you're sitting in it," said Terrence Wright, 34, a mover who lives on Piedmont Ave. "I went because a neighbor asked me to. I stayed because I couldn't leave."

Across town in East Oakland, Masjid Al-Islam activated its emergency assistance fund the same day, distributing financial aid to families in acute crisis. Imam Yusuf Kareem, who oversees the mosque's community programs, described the need as both ordinary and urgent. "People come to us before they come to anyone else," he said. "That is not a boast. It is a weight we carry with pride."

These two events — a grief circle in Piedmont and an emergency fund in East Oakland — were the emotional poles of what may be the most quietly significant week of community action this cycle. In total, twenty-two faith-institution events took place across ten neighborhoods, spanning Buddhist temples, Jewish synagogues, Islamic mosques, Christian churches, and a Hindu temple. Fourteen congregations held regular services. The Islamic Center of Oakland and Kehilla Synagogue both ran food pantries. The Oakland Buddhist Temple and East Bay Meditation Center hosted Losar observances. St. Columba Church and Acts Full Gospel Church each celebrated youth program graduations. Shiva Vishnu Temple held a job training workshop. And downtown, an interfaith council meeting brought leaders from multiple traditions to the same table.

All of it happened while City Hall consumed itself with the Stabilization Fund vote.

"I think people forget that these places were here before the council chambers and they'll be here after," said Isaac Martinez, 34, a plumber from Ivy Hill. "My family's church doesn't wait for a vote to feed somebody."

Mateo Williams, 53, a janitor in Chinatown, attended the interfaith council meeting as an observer. "I saw a rabbi and an imam comparing notes on rental assistance," he said. "No cameras. No speeches. Just two people with clipboards."

Gallery owner Mei Chen, a curator based in Laurel, has been documenting faith-based community work through a photography series at her gallery. "Art and faith share the same impulse," she said. "You make something where there was nothing. You hold space." Colin Phillips, 30, a bakery worker in Laurel, said he has visited Chen's gallery twice this month. "It changed how I see my own block," he said.

Rabbi Adler, closing the grief gathering on Piedmont Avenue, did not offer a sermon. She blew out the candle and thanked people for coming. The room was still for a moment before the chairs began to fold.

Twenty-two events. Ten neighborhoods. Five faith traditions. One week. No one called it extraordinary. That may be the point.

A'S OPEN CAMP WITH EYES ON OCTOBER — AND ONE THIRD BASEMAN'S EYES ON CITY HALL

By Anthony | Lead Sports Journalist

OAKLAND — The crack of bats echoed across the Howard Terminal complex Tuesday morning, and for the first time since that gut-punch Game 7 loss in Boston, the Oakland Athletics looked like a team ready to stop mourning and start working.

Spring training is underway. The A's opened their exhibition slate against San Diego over the weekend and are now deep into the rhythm of camp under first-year manager Deacon Seymour, who has spent the early days installing his system with the quiet intensity of a man who knows exactly how much is expected of him.

"We're not here to repeat last year," Seymour told reporters after Monday's full-squad workout. "We're here to finish what last year started."

That is the unspoken contract hanging over everything at camp. The 2041 Athletics are not a rebuilding project. They are a 105-win team that came within three outs of the World Series and watched it evaporate in the Fenway night. The ALCS loss to Boston in seven games left a mark that no offseason could fully sand away, and Seymour — promoted from bench coach after the departure of Mike Kindler — has leaned into the scar tissue rather than ignoring it.

By all accounts, his first camp has been crisp. Position players reported early. The energy has been competitive without being frantic. Seymour has reorganized the daily schedule to prioritize situational work — runners on third with less than two outs, relay throws, the small-game execution that abandoned Oakland in October.

"He's a detail guy," said veteran outfielder Marcus Keane, who is entering his final major league season. "First day, he had cutoff alignments on the board before anyone had even stretched. You respect that."

Keane, 38, has been the emotional center of camp. The organization announced last week that the 2041 season will serve as both a dynasty celebration and a farewell tour for the franchise's longest-tenured player. Keane has spent 14 seasons in green and gold, and teammates say his presence in the clubhouse this spring has carried a weight that goes beyond baseball.

"He pulled me aside the first morning and said, 'Make this one count,'" Seymour recalled. "Four words. But it set the tone for the whole room."

The rotation is taking shape. Rivas and Ramos will anchor the top of the staff, with Coles, Ellis, and the newly returned Matt Dillon rounding out the five. Dillon signed a one-year, $13 million deal in January and looked sharp in his first bullpen session, touching 94 on the gun. His presence gives Oakland a veteran fifth starter with postseason innings.

On the injury front, Darren Davis continues to progress. The reigning MVP took full batting practice Monday and fielded grounders without any visible limitation. The club expects him in the opening day lineup, barring setback.

But perhaps the most interesting story in camp this week did not happen on a diamond.

Third baseman Mark Aitken, Oakland's MLBPA representative, was not at Tuesday morning's optional workout. He was across town, seated in the public gallery of City Council chambers, watching the Stabilization Fund come to a floor vote.

The measure passed, 6-3.

Aitken, 29, has become an increasingly visible figure in Oakland civic life, attending community budget hearings and lending his platform to neighborhood advocacy groups. His appearance at the vote was not performative. He stayed for the full session and took notes.

"I live here," Aitken said in the clubhouse later that afternoon. "These decisions affect my neighbors. I've got a locker in this building, but I've also got a house three miles from here. The fund matters to people I see at the grocery store."

Seymour had no issue with his third baseman's morning absence.

"Mark's a grown man," the manager said. "He was here for the afternoon session, he got his work in, and frankly, I'd rather have a player who cares about his community than one who doesn't. That's the kind of clubhouse I want."

GM Mike Paulson is expected in camp Wednesday for roster discussions. The 40-man is largely set, but a few bullpen spots remain contested.

For now, the mood is cautiously optimistic. The talent is there. The health is trending right. The new manager has command of the room. And one third baseman is reminding everyone that a ballplayer can be more than a ballplayer.

October is a long way off. But for the first time since that cold night in Boston, it feels like something worth believing in again.

BULLS ROLL PAST HORNETS 108-91, PUSH CONFERENCE LEAD TO HISTORIC PACE

By Selena Grant | Bulls Beat

CHICAGO — The Charlotte Hornets came into the United Center on Wednesday night riding a modest three-game winning streak and some genuine belief that they had figured something out in the second half of their season.

The Bulls dismantled that belief in about eleven minutes.

Chicago scored 38 first-quarter points, held Charlotte to 17 in the same frame, and never looked back in a 108-91 demolition that pushed the Bulls' record to 34-14 — still the best mark in the Eastern Conference by a comfortable margin.

"We wanted to set the tone early," point guard Josh Giddey said. "Charlotte's been playing well. You can't let a team like that hang around and find confidence. So we came out and took it."

Giddey finished with 14 points, 11 assists, and 6 rebounds in just 29 minutes, his night effectively over by the middle of the third quarter when the lead ballooned to 27.

But the night belonged, once again, to Hank Trepagnier.

The rookie forward posted 22 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists — his third 20-10 game in the last two weeks and another entry in a Rookie of the Year portfolio that is becoming increasingly difficult to argue against. Trepagnier's season averages now sit at 16.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game.

"I don't think about the award," Trepagnier said after the game. "I think about winning. The award stuff, that's for other people to talk about. I just want to keep getting better every night."

His field goal percentage has climbed from 44.1 in November to 48.8 over his last fifteen games, and his turnover rate has dropped steadily as he has grown more comfortable reading NBA defenses.

Adash Stanley contributed 15 points off the bench in 24 minutes, continuing his own quietly impressive campaign. Stanley currently sits 5th in Rookie of the Year voting and 6th in Sixth Man consideration.

The victory was all the more notable given who was not in uniform. Matas Buzelis, who sits 3rd in Most Improved Player voting, missed his second consecutive game with a pinched nerve in his back. The team has listed him as out 3-4 weeks. Tre Jones also remains out with a broken left ankle, carrying a similar recovery window.

And yet the Bulls keep winning. They are 4-1 since Jones went down and have outscored opponents by an average of 11.3 points in that stretch. Under GM Mike Paulson, this roster — with an average age of just 24 — was built with exactly this kind of resilience in mind.

Which brings us to the whispers that will not stop.

The Golden State Warriors, sitting at 25-23, have confirmed organizational interest in Paulson's front office services. No formal offer has been made public. Paulson, through a team spokesperson, has declined to comment.

"We've got a GM who built this team," Giddey said when asked. "I'm not worried about rumors. I'm worried about Friday's game."

Charlotte never got closer than 14 in the second half. The Hornets shot 38 percent from the field and committed 19 turnovers. It was not a fair fight. Increasingly, Bulls games are not.

CHICAGO SNAPSHOT: SUMMER SOLSTICE WEEKEND

82°F | Clear skies | Long light, good feeling

By Talia Finch | Chicago Ground

The sun didn't set until 8:29 Saturday night, and half the city seemed determined to use every minute.

Grant Park was still crowded at eight. Kids chased each other through the fountain spray at Buckingham while their parents sat on blankets, faces tipped toward a sky that wouldn't quit. Along the lakefront trail, runners and cyclists shared the path well past the hour when, three months ago, they would have been home in the dark.

Summer Solstice is a minor holiday, but Chicago treats the longest day like a personal gift. This year, it arrived with the city already in a mood. The Bulls sit at 34-14, best record in the Eastern Conference, and the energy has seeped into everything — bar conversations, barbershop debates, the way strangers make eye contact on the L.

Tiffany Gonzalez, 76, a jazz musician in Bronzeville, has seen all of it. She moved to the neighborhood in 1971. She remembers the Jordan years. She remembers Rose.

"This feels different," Gonzalez said, sitting on her front porch Saturday evening with a glass of iced tea. "With Jordan, we knew. With Rose, we hoped. This team — people are letting themselves believe again. I can hear it in the street. People are lighter."

She played a set at a neighbor's solstice cookout later that night. Saxophone. Standards and some originals.

Thomas Jackson, 66, an insurance broker in the Loop, sees it from the commercial side. "My clients are in better moods," Jackson said. "That sounds like a small thing, but it isn't. People spend differently when they're optimistic. Restaurants are booked. The parking garages are full on weeknights. A winning team moves money through this city in ways people don't appreciate."

Derek Turner, 45, who runs a grocery store in Chinatown, put it more simply when I caught him restocking the cooler Sunday morning. "Longest day of the year," he said. "Best team in the East. Cold beer's flying off the shelf. What else do you need?"

Not much, apparently. Not this weekend.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

ON THE STABILIZATION FUND VOTE:

I sat in that hearing room and I said what I came to say. Three families on my block. 1847 Filbert. 1852 Filbert. 1859 Filbert. I gave you the addresses because I wanted the record to show that these were real houses with real people in them. The fund passed 6-3 last night and I should feel good about that. Part of me does. But I keep thinking about Maria at 1847 who let my kids use her garden hose in the summer. She's in Stockton now. The money is approved but the truck already left. I've been an electrician thirty-one years. I know you can't run current through a cut wire. You have to splice it first. I hope this fund is a splice and not just a press conference. I guess we'll see.

— Javier Harris, 57, West Oakland, Electrician

-----

ON THE FAITH COMMUNITY:

I'm not a churchgoing man. I want to say that upfront so nobody thinks I'm selling something. But I live two blocks from Beth Jacob Congregation and I saw what happened there last week. The grief gathering on Tuesday. The food pantry Wednesday and Thursday. Kids graduating from the youth program on Saturday, walking across a small stage in the parking lot while their grandmothers cried. None of it made the news. Not one camera. I work twelve-hour shifts at Highland and I know what community collapse looks like because I see it come through the doors. What I saw at Beth Jacob was the opposite of that. People holding each other up without being asked. I don't know what you call that if not essential infrastructure. Somebody should be paying attention.

— Devon Brown, 39, Piedmont Ave, Nurse aide

-----

ON LAKE MERRITT:

I moved to Lake Merritt nine years ago because I liked the pace of it. I liked knowing the regulars. I'm a barista so I notice things — who orders what, who sits where, who stops coming in. The last few months the line is out the door but half the faces are new. I'm not mad about it. Business is business. But the laundromat on my corner is now a coworking space. The taqueria raised its prices twice since October. My landlord mentioned "market adjustments" in an email last week, which is a phrase nobody uses when the adjustment is in your favor. I came here for a neighborhood that felt like it had room for someone making what I make. I just want to know if that's still the plan.

— Vanessa Thompson, 42, Lake Merritt, Barista
