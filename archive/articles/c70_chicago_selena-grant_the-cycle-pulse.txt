TREPAGNIER, BULLS ROLL INTO CUP QUARTERFINALS
Chicago's young core continues improbable run as Oakland watches from afar

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The Bulls closed out their Cup group play with a statement win over San Antonio, downing Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs 89-81 behind Hank Trepagnier's 29-point explosion.

Trepagnier, the 21-year-old center from El Salvador, has become the face of Chicago's unexpected ascent. His matchup against Wembanyama — the generational prospect everyone assumed would dominate the conversation — tilted Chicago's way. Trepagnier finished with four rebounds, a block, and the kind of defensive presence that forced San Antonio into contested shots all night.

Josh Giddey orchestrated from the point: 16 points, seven rebounds, 12 assists. The near-triple-double has become routine.

The Bulls sit at 9-1. Team chemistry has climbed to 77%. Fan interest hovers near 56% — numbers that would have seemed absurd in October.

"This is what development looks like," Mike Paulson said after the game, his first public appearance since the Chicago presser where he addressed the Oakland walkout. "We built the system. They're executing it."

Paulson watched from his courtside seat, phone in hand, already fielding texts about spring training in Mesa. The GM who runs two franchises sat in Chicago while his baseball team prepared for Arizona without him.

The quarterfinal matchup awaits: New York Knicks, featuring Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns. The game is set for Cycle 71.

HUERTER OUT 4-6 WEEKS WITH HIP INJURY
Veteran wing strained right hip in practice

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — Kevin Huerter, the veteran shooting guard who has served as the Bulls' stabilizing presence, will miss four to six weeks with a strained right hip.

The injury occurred during practice ahead of the Cup quarterfinal. Huerter had been averaging steady minutes off the bench, providing the kind of floor spacing and defensive discipline that young cores often lack.

"Kevin's presence goes beyond stats," Paulson said. "His professionalism sets the tone."

The Bulls will turn to Ayo Dosunmu and Tyrese Martin to fill the void. Neither brings Huerter's shooting touch, but both offer defensive energy.

The timing is brutal — Huerter will miss the Cup quarterfinal and likely the semifinal if Chicago advances. His return would coincide with the Cup Finals, should the Bulls get there.

DOWNTOWN DISRUPTION ENTERS SECOND CYCLE
Shock event remains unexplained as foot traffic patterns shift

By Luis Navarro | Bay Tribune Metro

The downtown shock event that triggered an all-desks alert in Cycle 69 has carried into Cycle 70. Arc strength has dropped slightly — from 3.53 to 3.46 — but the designation remains: unexpected disruption creating civic pressure.

Nobody has explained what happened.

Sofia Lopez, a longtime downtown resident, was among the first to notice the shift. "The rhythm changed," she said last cycle. "People moving faster. More deliberate."

That observation has held. Downtown foot traffic remains elevated. The Lake Merritt Blossom Walk drew crowds this cycle, as did the Downtown Plaza Noon Music Session — both suggesting the city is functioning, even if something unnamed lingers beneath the surface.

City officials have not issued statements. The Mayor's office referred questions to the City Manager's office, which did not respond.

The civic load remains stable. The shock flag remains active.

TEMESCAL HEALTH ARC CONTINUES — ILLNESS RATE HOLDS AT 9%
Wave 4 shows no signs of resolution

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Bay Tribune Health Desk

The fourth wave of Oakland's unexplained health pattern continues in Temescal. Arc strength has decreased from 3.77 to 3.62 — a slight improvement — but the city-wide illness rate remains at 9%.

Clinics continue watching closely. No symptom profile has been released. No connection to previous waves has been established.

What we know: Temescal residents are adjusting behavior. Multiple citizens logged health-related decisions in recent cycles — seeking information, prioritizing wellness, modifying routines.

What we don't know: What they're sick with. How it spreads. When it ends.

The wave remains in early phase. That designation could change in Cycle 71 if indicators shift.

I'll continue tracking.

POTHOLE ERUPTION REPORTED DOWNTOWN
Infrastructure event adds to downtown pressure

By Trevor Shimizu | Bay Tribune Infrastructure

A pothole eruption was reported in the Central district this cycle — the kind of minor infrastructure failure that barely registers in normal weeks.

This is not a normal week.

Downtown is already processing an unexplained shock event. Now the streets are literally breaking open.

Public Works has not commented on timeline for repair. The pothole affects a secondary arterial route, meaning traffic disruption should be minimal.

But the symbolism is hard to ignore: something underground forcing its way to the surface.

MIGRATION DRIFT IMPROVES TO -32

Population stands at 313,730 — up nearly 600 from last cycle. Employment remains stable at 91%. The economy holds.

MESA WAITS — PAULSON STILL IN CHICAGO
Spring training opens without GM present

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Spring training is officially underway. The equipment trucks arrived in Mesa. The fields are groomed. The roster is assembling.

Mike Paulson is in Chicago.

The GM watched the Bulls defeat San Antonio from courtside, then fielded questions about Deacon Seymour from reporters who had to remind him which sport they covered.

"We're extremely excited for what Deacon brings," Paulson repeated — the same phrase he used at the Chicago presser. Nothing new. No clarity on when he'll arrive.

Seymour has never managed a professional game. His first spring training as manager is happening right now. His boss is 1,800 miles away.

The lineup leak from Cycle 69 remains unexplained. The practice facility incident that cost a strength and conditioning coach their job remains murky. The questions are piling up.

The answers are in Chicago.

WARRIORS UPDATE: CURRY'S WARRIORS SIT AT 7-4
Bay Area's other team navigating early season

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

The Golden State Warriors are 7-4 through their first eleven games, good for sixth in the Western Conference.

Stephen Curry continues defying time: 35 points per game, 3.4 rebounds, 4.7 assists. The 37-year-old is shooting lights out and carrying a roster that lacks the depth of his championship years.

Jimmy Butler, in his first season with Golden State, is averaging 21.5 points. Jonathan Kuminga is contributing 17.9.

Team chemistry sits at an unimpressive 48% — a number that suggests the roster is still learning to play together.

The Warriors aren't Oakland's team, but they're the Bay's. And right now, they're somewhere between contender and pretender.

LAKE MERRITT BLOSSOM WALK DRAWS SPRING CROWDS

Clear skies. Fifty-eight degrees. The perfect day for Lake Merritt.

The Blossom Walk drew hundreds this cycle — families, joggers, couples pushing strollers around the lake as cherry trees dropped petals onto the path.

"This is Oakland," one visitor said. "This is why we stay."

The event coincided with the Downtown Plaza Noon Music Session, creating a rare moment where the city's civic pressure seemed to lift. People gathered. Music played. The sun cooperated.

Nightlife activity later hit 1.1 — up from 0.99 last cycle. Laurel Taproom was the evening's hot spot.

THE MAN IN TWO CHAIRS

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

Mike Paulson sat courtside in Chicago watching basketball while spring training opened in Mesa.

That's the sentence. That's the whole column.

He built both teams. He runs both franchises. He's allowed to be wherever he wants. But you can't be in two places at once. You have to choose.

And right now, he's choosing Chicago.

The Bulls are 9-1. The Bulls have Trepagnier dunking on Wembanyama. The Bulls have a quarterfinal against the Knicks. The Bulls are the shiny thing.

The A's have a first-time manager nobody's met. The A's have a lineup leak nobody's explained. The A's have a practice facility incident that cost someone their job.

The A's have questions. Chicago has answers.

I get it. I do. If I had two teams and one was about to make the Cup Finals while the other was doing stretches in Arizona, I'd probably be in Chicago too.

But I'm not the GM. I'm not the guy who walked out of an Oakland presser and disappeared for weeks. I'm not the guy who said "insensitive" and "overstepped" from a podium in another city.

Paulson's allowed to be in Chicago. But Oakland's allowed to notice where he is.

BULLS DEMOLISH KNICKS IN CUP QUARTERFINAL
Trepagnier explodes for career-high 38 points as Chicago advances

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The Bulls made a statement that echoed across both coasts.

Chicago demolished the New York Knicks 115-81 in the NBA Cup quarterfinal, the most lopsided victory of the tournament. Hank Trepagnier scored a career-high 38 points with 12 rebounds. Adash Stanley, the 19-year-old from Poland, added 21 points and went 5-for-9 from three. Josh Giddey conducted the orchestra: 16 points, 5 rebounds, 17 assists.

The Knicks never found their footing. Jalen Brunson finished with 16 points and six assists but shot 0-for-4 from deep. Karl-Anthony Towns managed just 10 points and six rebounds.

The United Center shook. The city believed.

"This is what we're building," Mike Paulson said after the game, standing outside the locker room. "Not a fluke. A foundation."

The Bulls are now 19-5. Team chemistry has climbed to 88%. They're the top seed in the Eastern Conference, third in power rankings, and one win from the Cup Finals.

The semifinal opponent: Detroit Pistons. The game: Cycle 72.

Paulson watched the entire game from courtside, three rows behind the bench. He did not fly to Mesa afterward.

KEANE FOR KIDS GALA RAISES RECORD FUNDS FOR OAKLAND YOUTH
Second annual charity event brings A's, celebrities, civic leaders together

By Kai Marston | Bay Tribune Culture

The second annual Keane for Kids Gala raised a record sum for Oakland youth programs, bringing together athletes, entertainers, and civic leaders for a night that reminded the city what it's capable of.

Vinnie Keane and his wife Amara hosted the black-tie affair at the Paramount Theatre. The official cause: the Keane Foundation for Oakland Youth, which funds after-school athletics, tutoring programs, and summer camps across East Oakland, Fruitvale, and West Oakland.

"This city gave me everything," Keane said during brief remarks. "Sixteen years. Six championships. A family. The least I can do is make sure the next generation has a shot."

The guest list read like a who's who of Oakland's sports and cultural scene:

From the A's: Darrin Davis, Mark Aitken, Henry Rivas, Travis Coles, and Benji Dillon. Davis, the MVP returning from ACL rehab, drew the loudest applause when introduced.

From the Bulls (via video): Josh Giddey and Matas Buzelis sent recorded messages from Chicago, where the team was preparing for the Cup quarterfinal.

From Oakland's Cultural Ledger: Evan Morello (actor), Marin Tao (musician), Nila James (athlete), Lena Cross (actor), Jade Orion (musician), and rising rapper Theo Banks, who performed a short acoustic set that had the room's attention.

Civic presence included representatives from the Mayor's office, though Mayor Avery Santana did not attend personally. Deputy Mayor Brenda Okoro delivered remarks on behalf of the administration.

Keane's wife Amara, who co-founded the organization, announced expansion plans: three new community centers to open by Year 3, targeting neighborhoods with the highest youth unemployment.

"Vinnie plays baseball," Amara Keane said. "I build programs. Together, we're trying to build something that outlasts us both."

The gala coincided with Mother's Day weekend. Multiple attendees noted the timing felt intentional.

Mike Paulson was not in attendance. His absence was noted but not addressed.

City records most positive mood since simulation began

Oakland felt different this cycle.

Sentiment surged to +0.53 — the most positive reading since the simulation began tracking. Retail activity climbed to 1.56. Nightlife hit 1.16. Public spaces scored 1.21. Community engagement reached 1.21.

Mother's Day brought families out across the city. The Rockridge Mother's Day Brunch Walk drew crowds to College Avenue. Restaurants reported wait times. Parks filled with picnics.

"This is what Oakland can be," one resident said outside Blue Lantern Bar. "When we're not worrying about everything else."

The health crisis in Temescal hasn't resolved. The downtown shock event hasn't been explained. The migration drift remains negative.

A'S NOTEBOOK: SPRING TRAINING UNDERWAY, SEYMOUR RUNNING THE SHOW

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Deacon Seymour is managing a baseball team.

Spring training is in full swing in Mesa. The pitchers are throwing. The position players are taking reps. The morning meetings are happening.

And Seymour is the one running them.

"He's got presence," one player said anonymously. "You can tell he's been around the game his whole life. He's just never been the one in charge."

The anticipated 2041 rotation — Rivas, Ramos, Coles, Ellis, Dillon — is taking shape. Henry Rivas, the 91-overall ace, threw his first bullpen session of the spring. Travis Coles, the 21-year-old phenom with the 2.05 ERA, impressed in live batting practice.

Benji Dillon, 38, is back in green and gold after re-signing for one year at $13 million. The "Golden Arm" won't admit this is a farewell tour, but everyone's treating it like one.

Darrin Davis continues his ACL rehab. He's on track for preseason at-bats. The MVP's leg is responding.

Vinnie Keane, fresh off hosting the Keane for Kids Gala, arrived in camp the next morning. This is his final season. He's making every day count.

Mike Paulson remains in Chicago.

CHICAGO — The city is holding its breath.

The Bulls' quarterfinal destruction of the Knicks sent expectations through the roof. Now Detroit comes to town for the semifinal, with a spot in the Cup Finals on the line.

The Pistons have Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren. They have playoff experience the Bulls lack. They have something to prove after a slow start to the season.

But Chicago has Trepagnier. Chicago has Giddey. Chicago has the 19-year-old kid from Poland who dropped 21 on the Knicks like it was a summer league scrimmage.

BULLS SURVIVE DETROIT, ADVANCE TO CUP FINALS
Giddey's 26 points, Trepagnier's 23 power Chicago past Pistons 95-88

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The Bulls are going to the Cup Finals.

In a tense semifinal that required separating players in the final seconds, Chicago outlasted Detroit 95-88 to clinch a berth in the NBA Cup championship game. Josh Giddey led with 26 points, four rebounds, and 10 assists. Hank Trepagnier added 23 points and 12 rebounds. Adash Stanley contributed 17 points and six assists despite a late-game altercation with Detroit's Marcus Sasser that required officials to intervene with 16 seconds remaining.

"Playoff basketball," Paulson said after the game. "This is what it looks like."

The Pistons, playing without injured star Cade Cunningham, got 31 points and 10 rebounds from Jalen Duren. But it wasn't enough. Chicago's defense clamped down in the fourth quarter, forcing seven turnovers in the final eight minutes.

The Cup Finals opponent: Minnesota Timberwolves. The game: Cycle 73.

Chicago hasn't reached a championship round in any format since the Jordan years. The drought ends now.

Paulson remained in Chicago throughout the semifinal. He was seen on the phone multiple times during timeouts. Sources say he was receiving updates from Mesa.

TWO CIVIC OFFICIALS IN SERIOUS CONDITION
Deputy Mayor Osei, Councilmember Crane both hospitalized

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic

Two of Oakland's civic officials are in serious medical condition, according to status alerts released this cycle.

Marcus Osei, 50, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, is listed in serious condition. Elliott Crane, 63, the Business Caucus Leader on City Council, is listed as injured.

No details have been released regarding the nature of their conditions or the circumstances. The Mayor's office issued a brief statement asking for privacy and expressing hope for swift recoveries.

Osei has been the city's lead negotiator on public-private stadium deals, including the Baylight District plan to bring the A's back to Oakland permanently. Crane, representing District 6, has been the council's primary voice for developer interests and business-friendly policy.

Their simultaneous absence creates a vacuum in two critical areas of civic function: economic development and council leadership on business matters.

City Manager Aaron Whitfield said operations would continue without interruption. "Our systems are resilient," he said. "We wish Marcus and Elliott full recoveries."

No timeline for their return has been provided.

SEASONAL ALLERGY SPIKE REPORTED AT LAKE MERRITT
Health desk flags elevated symptoms across lakefront area

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Bay Tribune Health Desk

A seasonal allergy spike has been logged at Lake Merritt — the first health event flagged outside the ongoing Temescal arc.

The severity is listed as high, though the event type suggests environmental rather than pathogenic causes. Spring pollen counts have been elevated across the East Bay, and Lake Merritt's proximity to vegetation makes it a natural hotspot.

This is separate from the Wave 4 health crisis in Temescal, which continues at 9% illness rate with no symptom profile disclosed.

The allergy spike is a reminder: not every health flag is a crisis. Sometimes spring is just spring.

Residents with respiratory sensitivities should monitor air quality reports.

MAYOR SANTANA RENEWS PRESSURE FOR A'S RETURN
Executive calls for permanent Oakland stadium solution

By Anthony | Bay Tribune Sports

Mayor Avery Santana isn't letting the stadium issue rest.

In remarks this cycle, Santana reapplied pressure to bring the A's back to Oakland permanently after the team played last season at the Diamondbacks' stadium in Phoenix.

"Oakland is the A's home," Santana said. "The Baylight District plan is ready. The city is ready. We need commitment from ownership."

The A's have operated in a state of geographic limbo for years. The planned Baylight District development — which would include a new stadium, mixed-use residential, and commercial space — has been Santana's signature initiative since taking office in 2036.

With Deputy Mayor Marcus Osei hospitalized, the city's lead stadium negotiator is temporarily unavailable. Chief of Staff Laila Cortez is expected to handle interim discussions.

Mike Paulson, the A's GM, has not publicly addressed the stadium situation in recent cycles. He's been in Chicago.

SPRING TRAINING CONTINUES — SEYMOUR FINDING HIS FOOTING

Vinnie Keane arrived in Mesa after hosting the Keane for Kids Gala. The 38-year-old third baseman, in his final season, has taken Seymour under his wing — ironic, given Keane played for three different A's managers before this one.

"Deacon knows the game," Keane said. "He just needs reps. We all do."

Darrin Davis continues rehabbing. His preseason at-bats are on schedule.

Jimmy Butler is contributing 19.2 points, five rebounds, and five assists. But team chemistry sits at just 48% — a troubling number that suggests the pieces aren't fitting together.

Power ranking: 9th. Division standing: 2nd behind the Kings.

CHICAGO REPORT

CHICAGO AWAITS CUP FINALS — CITY ENERGY AT PEAK

By Talia Finch | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — The city hasn't felt like this in decades.

The Bulls are in the Cup Finals. The opponent is Minnesota. The game is Cycle 73.

Bars are planning watch parties. Murals are going up on the South Side. The conversation everywhere — the El, the offices, the coffee shops — is basketball.

"This is what it felt like in '96," one longtime Bulls fan said outside the United Center. "Not the same team. Not the same era. But the same energy."

Mike Paulson built this. Whatever Oakland thinks of him, whatever questions remain about his divided attention, he built a team that brought a city back to life.

The Cup Finals await. Chicago is ready.

KESSLER TRADE SPECULATION HEATS UP
Trepagnier's emergence makes veteran center expendable

By Selena Grant | Bay Tribune Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — Walker Kessler's days as a Bull may be numbered.

With Hank Trepagnier now firmly entrenched as the starting center, Kessler has moved to the bench — and trade speculation has followed. The Bulls have been accumulating draft picks all season, and moving Kessler could yield additional assets.

Names floated in rumors include Giannis Antetokounmpo (unlikely), Devin Booker (unlikely), Anthony Edwards (unlikely), and Ja Morant (intriguing).

The Morant possibility is worth watching. Memphis has struggled, and Morant has been linked to "change of scenery" speculation. Adding a dynamic point guard to pair with Giddey would give Chicago a backcourt unlike anything in the league.

For now, it's speculation. But Paulson has shown he's willing to make aggressive moves. The Bulls' war chest is growing.

JACK LONDON OUTDOOR YOGA SESSION DRAWS MORNING CROWD

By Maria Keen | Bay Tribune Culture

The Jack London district hosted an outdoor yoga session this cycle, drawing early-morning participants to the waterfront.

The event coincided with clear skies and 67-degree temperatures — perfect conditions for movement.

Cultural activity across the city remains elevated at 1.2. The nightlife volume hit 6, with Uptown Pour House and KONO Cocktails leading evening activity.

Oakland's arts district continues stirring. The Winter Riverfront Festival may be months past, but the energy it planted is still growing.

OPINION
============================================================

TWO OFFICIALS DOWN

By Farrah Del Rio | Bay Tribune Opinion

Marcus Osei. Elliott Crane. Two names most Oakland residents couldn't pick out of a lineup. Two officials whose absence will be felt across city hall.

Osei negotiates stadium deals. Crane represents business interests on the council. Together, they represent the pragmatic center of Oakland governance — the people who make things happen behind closed doors while the Mayor takes the podium.

Now they're both hospitalized. No details. No timeline. Just "serious condition" and "injured."

Oakland's civic machinery keeps running. Aaron Whitfield says so. Laila Cortez will handle what needs handling. The system is resilient.

But two key pieces are missing. And we don't know when they're coming back.

This city carries a lot. Now it carries this too.

THE FINALS AWAIT

By P Slayer | Fan Columnist

The Bulls are in the Cup Finals.

I'll write that again, because I still don't believe it: The Bulls are in the Cup Finals.

Trepagnier is a star. Stanley is fearless. Giddey is conducting a symphony. And Paulson — wherever you stand on Paulson — built this from nothing.

Oakland is watching. Some of us are jealous. Some of us are proud. Most of us are both.

The A's are in Arizona. The stadium is in Phoenix. The GM is in Chicago. And the Bulls are playing for a championship.

Mike Paulson said the system travels. He was right.

Now we wait to see if it wins.
