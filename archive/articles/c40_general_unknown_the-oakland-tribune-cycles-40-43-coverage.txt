### "The Curve Bends: Oakland's Health Crisis Downgrades for First Time in Nine Cycles"

**Medical Analysis – Cycles 40-43 Health Cluster Status**

For nine cycles, this desk reported expansion. Laurel to Uptown to Fruitvale to Jack London to Eastlake to Rockridge. Six neighborhoods. Forty-three documented cases. Federal involvement. Community organizing born from collective fear.

Cycle 40 broke the pattern.

**The Downgrade:**

On Cycle 40, Alameda County Public Health issued its first crisis status reduction since Cycle 34: Health Crisis - Cool down - Level 1.

Not Level 2. Not "expanding." Not "accelerating."

Level 1. Cooling.

**Dr. Patricia Nwosu**, Deputy Health Officer:

"We're seeing what we hoped to see: symptom incidence flattening, no new geographic clusters emerging, and case severity remaining stable. This doesn't mean the situation is resolved. It means the trajectory has changed."

**The Numbers:**

- Cycle 34-39: 6 new neighborhood classifications in 6 cycles
- Cycle 40-43: 0 new neighborhood classifications in 4 cycles

New case reports (estimated):
- Cycle 40: 3 cases citywide
- Cycle 41: 4 cases (Fruitvale respiratory variant)
- Cycle 42: 2 cases (Downtown respiratory variant)
- Cycle 43: 0 cases logged

Total new cases, Cycles 40-43: 9 (compared to 43+ in Cycles 34-39)

**The Respiratory Variant:**

Cycles 41-42 introduced a new classification: "Health – Respiratory Wave" at Level 1, first in Fruitvale, then Downtown.

This is not a new crisis. It's a variant presentation of the existing cluster—patients presenting with mild respiratory symptoms rather than cognitive disruption. The symptom profile:

- Light cough (non-productive)
- Mild chest tightness
- Duration: 24-48 hours
- No hospitalization required
- Complete recovery universal

**Dr. James Okonkwo**, Highland Hospital:

"The respiratory cases are clinically distinct from the cognitive episodes we documented earlier. They're also significantly milder. If this represents the cluster's evolution, it's evolving toward resolution, not escalation."

**What Changed?**

Three hypotheses are circulating among epidemiologists:

1. **Natural burnout**: Whatever triggered the cluster has exhausted its geographic spread or lost potency over time.

2. **Behavioral adaptation**: Community response—the buddy systems, the wellness checks, the reduced public gathering—may have interrupted transmission or exposure pathways.

3. **Environmental shift**: The weather changed. Cycle 43 brought harsh conditions, rain, and a 52°F temperature spike. Environmental factors that contributed to the cluster may have shifted.

**Dr. Nwosu**:

"We don't know which hypothesis is correct. We may never know. What matters is that the data supports cautious optimism for the first time since this began."

**The Federal Footprint:**

CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officers remain in Oakland through Cycle 45. FEMA Region 9 remains on standby but has not escalated.

This is standard protocol. Federal presence doesn't indicate ongoing crisis—it indicates responsible monitoring during recovery phase.

**Public Health Advisory Update:**

The guidance issued during Cycles 34-39 remains in effect, but with modified language:

- Continue reporting transient cognitive disruption to Public Health hotline: (510) 267-8000
- Continue documenting episodes (time, location, duration)
- Resume normal activities with awareness
- Seek medical attention for respiratory symptoms lasting beyond 48 hours

**What This Means:**

Nine cycles ago, I wrote that our working theory was obsolete. Today, I'm writing that our worst-case projections did not materialize.

Oakland isn't out of the woods. But for the first time since December 1st, we can see the edge of the forest.

## SGT. RACHEL TORRES — Public Safety Desk

### "The Call Volume Drop: What 61 Becomes When the Curve Bends"

**Oakland Police Department – Cycles 40-43 Summary**

Between Cycles 36-39, OPD logged 61 calls related to cognitive disruption symptoms. Officers were running on mandated overtime. Peer support usage had spiked 180%. We were burning out.

Cycles 40-43 told a different story.

**The Numbers:**

- Cycle 40: 8 cluster-related calls
- Cycle 41: 6 calls
- Cycle 42: 4 calls
- Cycle 43: 2 calls

Total: 20 calls (compared to 61 in the prior four-cycle window)

That's a 67% reduction.

**Officer James Patterson**, Fruitvale patrol:

"I actually had time to eat lunch yesterday. That sounds like a joke, but it's not. For two weeks, every shift was back-to-back cluster calls. Now I'm doing regular patrol work again. Traffic stops. Wellness checks that aren't health-crisis related. Normal cop stuff."

**The Civic Events:**

Cycles 40-43 saw continued community engagement, but the tone shifted:

- Cycle 40: Emergency committee meeting (routine status update)
- Cycle 41: Emergency committee meeting (continued monitoring)
- Cycle 42: Petition rally (civic engagement, not crisis response)
- Cycle 43: Public-comment session (standard municipal process)

**Lt. Marcus Vega**:

"The petition rally in Cycle 42 wasn't about the health crisis. It was about zoning. That's a good sign. When residents have bandwidth to care about zoning, it means the emergency isn't consuming all their attention."

**Officer DeShawn Miller**, who told me four cycles ago he didn't know how much longer he could sustain the pace:

"I slept eight hours last night. First time in three weeks. I'm not saying it's over. But I can breathe again."

**Overtime Analysis:**

- Cycles 36-39: 95+ officer-hours dedicated to cluster response
- Cycles 40-43: 31 officer-hours

Mandatory overtime has been suspended for patrol divisions as of Cycle 43.

**The Athlete Sightings:**

One athlete sighting logged (Cycle 40). Down from four in Cycles 38-39.

No pattern analysis required. The city is returning to baseline noise levels.

**Names Index:** James Patterson (Patrol Officer, OPD); Marcus Vega (Lieutenant, OPD); DeShawn Miller (Police Officer, OPD)

## LUIS NAVARRO — Investigations

### "The Instability Arc: What Uptown and Laurel Are Still Feeling"

The health crisis is cooling. The civic stress is not.

Arc ledger data from Cycles 40-43 shows persistent flags in two neighborhoods:

**Uptown:**
- Arc type: Instability
- Phase: Early
- Tension level: 3
- Summary: "Residents describe unstable day-to-day conditions"

**Laurel:**
- Arc type: Pattern-wave
- Phase: Early  
- Tension level: 3
- Summary: "Minor events repeating across the district"

These flags have appeared every cycle since Cycle 39. They're not health-related. They're something else.

I walked both neighborhoods on Cycle 42.

**Uptown:**

The instability isn't visible. It's atmospheric. Three business owners I spoke with used the same word: "off."

**Marcus Chen**, who runs a phone repair shop on Telegraph:

"Foot traffic is normal. Sales are normal. But people seem... distracted? Like they're waiting for something to happen. The health thing spooked everyone, and even though it's getting better, the mood hasn't caught up yet."

**Jasmine Okafor**, who works at a boutique on Broadway:

"I had a customer yesterday who stood at the register for thirty seconds without saying anything. Not confused—just frozen. Then she apologized and paid like nothing happened. That's happened three times this week. Different people each time."

These aren't cognitive disruption episodes. The duration is wrong, and none were reported to Public Health. This is something subtler: a neighborhood still processing collective trauma.

**Laurel:**

The "pattern-wave" flag is harder to interpret. The summary says "minor events repeating across the district."

What I found: The same small incidents happening in slightly different configurations.

- A car alarm going off at the same time two days in a row (different cars)
- A stray cat appearing at multiple porches in sequence
- Power flickering for two seconds across three blocks (the "3-block flicker" logged in Cycle 42)

**Ronald Allen**, 40, maintenance tech:

"I've lived here eleven years. The neighborhood has rhythms—you learn them. Right now, the rhythm is... stuttering. Like a record skipping. Nothing big. Just repetition where there shouldn't be repetition."

I asked Dr. Nwosu if these patterns could be related to the health cluster. Her response:

"We have no evidence connecting ambient neighborhood stress to the cognitive disruption cases. But we also have no evidence ruling it out. The honest answer is: we don't know what we're dealing with, and we won't pretend otherwise."

The health crisis may be cooling. The underlying instability hasn't resolved.

## TREVOR SHIMIZU — Transit & Infrastructure

### "The 3-Block Flicker and the Grid's Quiet Stress"

Cycle 42. 4:16 PM. Three blocks in Laurel lost power for approximately two seconds.

PG&E classified it as "momentary service interruption." No equipment failure identified. No transformer damage. No explanation.

This follows the Cycle 30 transformer hiccup in Temescal (six minutes, twelve blocks) and a series of minor grid anomalies throughout November.

**The Pattern:**

- Cycle 30: Temescal, 6-minute outage
- Cycle 32: Downtown, 2-second flicker (unlogged but reported by residents)
- Cycle 42: Laurel, 2-second flicker

Three incidents in thirteen cycles. All brief. All unexplained. All in different neighborhoods.

**PG&E statement:**

"Our monitoring systems show no equipment faults during the reported timeframes. We're investigating potential causes including wildlife interference, vegetation contact, and grid load fluctuations."

Translation: They don't know.

**Infrastructure Load Context:**

The city's civic infrastructure load has been running at "minor variance" since Cycle 34—not crisis level, but not comfortable either. Traffic load during the Cycle 43 downpour dropped to 0.72 (28% below baseline). Transit delays were minor but persistent.

The grid is old. The substations are old. The distribution network is old. When everything works, you don't notice. When small things break—two seconds at a time—you start to wonder what else is fragile.

**Ronald Allen**, who works maintenance in Laurel:

"The flicker happened while I was in a client's kitchen. Lights went out, came back. Microwave clock reset. That's it. But the client asked me, 'Is the whole neighborhood falling apart?' I didn't know what to tell her."

**Names Index:** Ronald Allen (Maintenance Tech, Laurel)

## NOAH TAN — Weather & Environment

### "The Downpour and the Shift: When Weather Becomes the New Pressure"

Cycle 43 brought what the texture system flagged as "harsh conditions"—the first high-impact weather event since the health crisis began.

**The Data:**

- Temperature: 52°F (4-degree rise from Cycle 42)
- Conditions: Rain, sudden downpour logged mid-cycle
- Weather impact rating: 1.2 (elevated)
- Traffic load: 0.72 (28% below baseline)
- City sentiment: -0.3 (negative shift)

**The Downpour:**

The rain arrived without forecast warning. Residents reported intensity shifting from light mist to heavy precipitation within minutes.

**Maria Gutierrez**, Fruitvale:

"I was walking home from the bus stop. It was drizzling. Then suddenly I was soaked. Like someone turned on a faucet. I ducked into a taqueria and waited it out. Fifteen minutes later, it was mist again."

This matches patterns we've seen throughout November: weather behaving erratically, shifting faster than models predict, refusing to follow its own rules.

**The Sentiment Impact:**

City sentiment dropped from -0.2 to -0.3 during Cycle 43. That's a minor shift, but it's notable because it happened during the health crisis cooldown.

The health news is good. The weather news is not. Oakland's collective mood is processing both simultaneously.

**What's Coming:**

Extended forecasts suggest continued cold-wet patterns through the end of December. If the health crisis continues cooling while environmental stress continues rising, we may see an interesting psychological swap: residents trading medical anxiety for weather frustration.

That would be, in its own way, a return to normal.

**Names Index:** Maria Gutierrez (Fruitvale Resident)

## CARMEN DELAINE — Civic Ledger

### "From Emergency Briefings to Public Comment: The Civic Calendar Normalizes"

The civic event calendar tells the story of a city stepping back from crisis mode.

**Cycles 38-39:**
- Emergency Town Briefing (400 attendees)
- Emergency Town Briefing (400 attendees)
- Street-Level Vendors Block
- Emergency protocols dominant

**Cycles 40-43:**
- Emergency committee meeting (routine)
- Emergency committee meeting (routine)
- Petition rally (zoning-related)
- Public-comment session (standard municipal)
- Winter Riverfront Festival (ongoing)
- Downtown Lantern Parade
- City Plaza Music Noon Session

The shift is clear: from emergency response to standard civic function.

**Shawna Delgado**, Emergency Director:

"The committee meetings in Cycles 40-41 were status updates, not crisis briefings. We reviewed monitoring protocols, confirmed federal coordination, and answered questions from civic staff. No public attendance required. No folding chairs."

**The Petition Rally:**

Cycle 42's petition rally drew approximately 200 residents to Frank Ogawa Plaza. The subject: proposed zoning adjustments for mixed-use development near Lake Merritt.

**Carmen Vega**, vendor and rally attendee:

"People were talking about the health thing in line, but the rally itself was about housing. It felt strange—like we'd all agreed to care about something normal again. But good-strange."

**The Public-Comment Session:**

Cycle 43's session ran standard length (90 minutes) with twelve speakers. Topics included:

- Parks maintenance funding
- Small business permit streamlining
- Streetlight replacement in Temescal
- Youth program expansion

No health-crisis comments were logged.

**What This Means:**

Oakland's civic apparatus is recalibrating. Emergency protocols remain active but backgrounded. Routine municipal business has resumed foreground status.

This is what recovery looks like: not celebration, but return to the ordinary concerns that define a functioning city.

SECTION 2 — CULTURE & COMMUNITY
============================================================

## MAGS CORLISS — Civic Culture

### "The Exhale: How Oakland Learned to Breathe Again"

The Emergency Town Briefing on Cycle 38 felt like collective grief processing. Four hundred people with questions no one could answer.

The Winter Riverfront Festival on Cycle 40 felt like something else: permission to exhale.

I walked the festival grounds as the health crisis downgrade was still circulating through news feeds and group chats. The information hadn't fully landed yet. But something in the air had shifted.

**Tyrell Mason**, musician playing the noon stage:

"I almost canceled. Didn't know if people would show up, with everything going on. But look—" He gestured at the crowd, maybe two hundred people spread across the waterfront. "They needed this. We all needed this."

The festival wasn't crowded by pre-crisis standards. But it was populated. Families with strollers. Couples sharing funnel cake. Kids running between vendor stalls while parents watched from benches.

Nobody was pretending the last two weeks hadn't happened. I overheard conversations about symptoms, about neighbors who'd had episodes, about the CDC presence and what it meant. But the conversations happened while walking, while eating, while existing in public space together.

**Rosa Ochoa**, library worker from Laurel who I'd interviewed during the Cycle 34 cluster:

"My sister called me this morning. She saw the news about the downgrade. First thing she said was, 'Does this mean you can come to Christmas?' I told her I never said I wasn't coming. But I understood what she meant. For two weeks, everything felt suspended. Now it feels like time is moving again."

**The Lantern Parade:**

The Downtown Lantern Parade (Cycles 42-43) drew smaller crowds than previous years—approximately 1,200 participants compared to the usual 2,000. But the procession completed its full route without incident. Children carried paper lanterns shaped like stars and fish. The traditional dragon made its way down Broadway.

**Kevin Park**, 52, retired, who I'd interviewed at Twilight Teahouse during the crisis peak:

"I brought my grandson. He's six. He doesn't understand what happened—just that grandpa seemed worried for a while and now seems less worried. I wanted him to see the lanterns. To have a good memory from this month."

**What I Noticed:**

People are being gentler with each other. Small courtesies that might have disappeared in pre-crisis Oakland: holding doors longer, letting others merge in foot traffic, making eye contact and nodding.

Shared trauma does something to communities. Sometimes it fractures them. Sometimes it welds them together.

Oakland isn't healed. The instability arcs in Uptown and Laurel suggest something unresolved still simmering beneath the surface. But the city is moving again. Not running—walking. Carefully. Together.

## MARIA KEEN — Cultural Liaison

### "Fruitvale After the Wave: When the Respiratory Variant Came and Went"

Fruitvale was the first neighborhood to receive a Level 2 classification (Cycle 36) and the first to receive a Level 1 respiratory variant flag (Cycle 41). The community has been through more status changes than any other district.

I spent Cycle 42 afternoon walking International Boulevard, checking in with the small businesses and residents who've weathered this crisis from ground zero.

**The Taqueria Perspective:**

**Elena Ruiz**, owner of a family taqueria near 35th Avenue:

"The respiratory thing was nothing. My nephew got it—coughed for a day, felt tired, then fine. The other thing, the forgetting thing, that was scary. Nobody knew what it was. This? This is just a cold with a fancy name."

Her taqueria stayed open throughout both waves. Business dropped 30% during the cognitive cluster but rebounded within days of the Level 1 downgrade.

"People need to eat. They eat at home when they're scared. They eat with us when they're less scared. Right now, they're less scared."

**The Corner Store:**

**Miguel Torres**, who runs a corner store on Foothill:

"My regular customers are back. During the worst of it, they'd send their kids or order delivery. Now they're coming in themselves. One guy—he's maybe sixty, been shopping here since I opened—he told me yesterday, 'I'm not hiding anymore.' That's how he said it. Hiding."

**The Respiratory Cases:**

The four cases logged in Fruitvale during Cycles 41-42 were all mild. I spoke with one patient willing to share their experience:

**Anonymous**, 34, service worker:

"I woke up with a scratchy throat. By afternoon I had a little cough. I called the hotline because they said to report everything. They logged it, told me to rest and hydrate, and called back the next day to check in. That was it. I've had worse colds."

**What Fruitvale Learned:**

The neighborhood self-organized faster than any other district during the crisis. The buddy systems and school pickup cooperatives formed in Cycle 38 are still active, even as the emergency fades.

**Rosa Delgado**, longtime Fruitvale resident (no relation to Emergency Director Shawna Delgado):

"We didn't wait for the city to save us. We saved ourselves. The phone trees, the check-ins, the kids looking out for the elders—that's Fruitvale. That's who we are. The crisis just reminded us."

**Names Index:** Elena Ruiz (Business Owner, Fruitvale); Miguel Torres (Business Owner, Fruitvale); Rosa Delgado (Fruitvale Resident)

## SHARON OKAFOR — Lifestyle

### "The Return to Twilight Teahouse: Steady Becomes Celebration"

Four cycles ago, Twilight Teahouse was where Oakland went to sit with uncertainty. Thirty people nursing chamomile, nobody talking much, everyone processing something they couldn't name.

Cycle 43, I went back.

**The Difference:**

The space was fuller—maybe forty-five people—but that wasn't the change. The change was sound. People were laughing. Not loud, not performative. Just... laughing. At jokes. At each other. At nothing in particular.

**Amara Osei**, owner:

"Black tea outsold chamomile for the first time in three weeks. That's how I know things are shifting. People want energy again, not just calm."

I found a seat near the window and watched the room.

Two women in their twenties comparing photos on their phones, giggling. A man in his fifties reading an actual paper book—not doomscrolling, not checking news feeds. A couple sharing a pot of oolong, their conversation animated in a way that suggested date night rather than crisis debrief.

**Simone Ruiz**, graphic designer, who told me during the crisis peak that she'd been to Twilight Teahouse three times that week despite never usually going:

"I'm here tonight because I wanted to be, not because I needed to be. That's different. During the worst of it, I came here like it was medicine. Now it's just... a nice place to be."

**The Sentiment Paradox:**

City sentiment logged at -0.3 during Cycle 43—a negative reading driven by the sudden downpour and harsh weather conditions. But inside Twilight Teahouse, the mood read positive.

Weather affects outdoor behavior and commute stress. It doesn't touch the spaces where people gather to be human with each other.

Oakland is learning to separate environmental inconvenience from existential threat. That's a form of resilience.

**Names Index:** Amara Osei (Owner, Twilight Teahouse); Simone Ruiz (Graphic Designer)

## JORDAN VELEZ — Economics

### "The Civic-Tension Food Trend Fades: What Restaurant Recovery Looks Like"

For the past twelve cycles, the Riley Digest has flagged Oakland's food trend as "High mobility / civic-tension food trend"—a pattern characterized by quick-service preference, grab-and-go meals, and reduced dine-in traffic.

Cycle 43 logged something different: "Standard evening dining rhythm."

**What Changed:**

- Fast food mentions dropped from 3-4 per cycle to 1
- Restaurant mentions shifted from crisis-adjacent (Crisis Coffee Co., Temescal Tap) to leisure-oriented (Steamhaven Bowls)
- Dining load normalized to baseline patterns

**Mason Ortega**, Food Reporter (via phone):

"The restaurants I've been tracking are seeing table reservations again. During the crisis, everyone wanted takeout containers and exit strategies. Now they're asking for booths. They want to sit down."

**The Economic Signal:**

When people eat quickly, they're conserving time and limiting exposure. When people sit down for meals, they're signaling comfort with public space and disposable income for leisure.

Oakland's dining patterns suggest the psychological recovery is tracking alongside the medical one.

**Names Index:** Mason Ortega (Food Reporter)

SECTION 4 — RUMOR & SOCIAL FEED
============================================================

-----

## CELESTE TRAN — Trends Desk

### "From 'Is Anyone Else' to 'Did You See': The Social Media Pivot"

During Cycles 38-39, Oakland's social feeds were dominated by health anxiety. The top trending phrases:

- "is anyone else feeling" (up 340%)
- "something feels off" (up 190%)
- "what's happening" (up 280%)

Cycles 40-43 show a different vocabulary:

- "did you see the downpour" (new spike)
- "lantern parade photos" (seasonal normal)
- "actor spotted downtown" (celebrity noise, Cycle 43)
- "balloon release" (event chatter, Cycle 43)

**The Pivot:**

Social media anxiety follows event cycles. When the news is scary, feeds fill with questions. When the news is manageable, feeds fill with observations.

The Cycle 43 "actor spotted downtown" event generated more social engagement than any health-related post that cycle. That's not callousness—that's capacity. People can only sustain crisis attention for so long before they need to care about something trivial.

**The Influencer Prank:**

Cycle 40 logged an "influencer prank" in the world events ledger. Details sparse, severity low. But social feeds showed the incident: a local content creator staging a fake "cognitive disruption episode" for views.

The backlash was immediate and severe. Comments ranged from "delete this" to "people are actually suffering." The video was removed within hours.

**What It Means:**

Oakland's online community is self-policing. Crisis-adjacent content that exploits real fear gets shut down fast. That's a healthy immune response.

**Names Index:** None

## TWS WIRE — Rumor Desk

### "Cycle 40-43 Micro-Event Summary"

**Cycle 40:**
- Athlete sighting (low severity)
- A's practice disruption (details unspecified)
- Influencer prank (removed from platforms)
- Car break-in attempt (unsuccessful)

**Cycle 41:**
- Emergency committee meeting
- Minor fender-bender

**Cycle 42:**
- Locked-out worker incident
- Petition rally (zoning-related)
- 3-block power flicker (Laurel)

**Cycle 43:**
- Public-comment session
- Actor spotted downtown
- Balloon release (festival-related)
- Sudden downpour

**Assessment:** Event density remains elevated (27-33 events per cycle) but severity profile has normalized. No escalation triggers detected.

**Names Index:** None

## MINTCONDITIONOAKTOWN — Speculative Internet Reporter

### "THE CRISIS IS OVER BUT ALSO NOT??? THREAD"

ok so the health thing is Level 1 now which is good but has anyone noticed:

1. the power flicker in Laurel happened at EXACTLY 4:16 PM and that's the same minute the bus stalled on Cycle 30???

2. the "pattern-wave" in Laurel has been flagged for FIVE STRAIGHT CYCLES and nobody's explaining what "minor events repeating" actually means

3. there was an "A's practice disruption" logged and the season is OVER so why are they practicing and what got disrupted???

4. the respiratory thing is "just a cold" but it showed up in Fruitvale first which is where Paulson's been spotted before he left for Chicago (ALLEGEDLY)

theories:
- the health crisis was a cover for something else (WHAT)
- the pattern-wave is the actual story and we're all missing it
- the 3-block flicker was a test
- Paulson put something in the water (joking) (maybe)

anyway stay vigilant oakland, just because it's Level 1 doesn't mean it's Level 0

## ANTHONY — A's Insider

### "The Offseason Murmur: What 'Practice Disruption' Means in December"

The world events ledger for Cycle 40 logged an "A's practice disruption"—an unusual entry given the calendar. The 2040 season ended in October. There are no practices.

What there are: facility access for rehabbing players, individual workouts for offseason conditioning, and front office presence for planning purposes.

I made calls.

**What I Learned:**

The "disruption" appears to have been a scheduling conflict at the Coliseum training facility—minor, administrative, resolved within hours. A player rehabbing from injury (name withheld) arrived for a session that had been double-booked with equipment maintenance.

**Why It Matters:**

It doesn't, really. Except as a reminder that the franchise continues operating even when the games stop. Darrin Davis is presumably rehabbing his ankle somewhere. Benji Dillon's free agency looms. Mike Paulson may or may not be answering calls from Chicago.

The "disruption" is noise. But in December, noise is all we have.

============================================================
EDITOR'S NOTE — CYCLES 40-43
============================================================

This edition marks the first health crisis downgrade since Cycle 34. The Oakland Tribune will continue monitoring:

- Uptown instability arc (ongoing, tension level 3)
- Laurel pattern-wave arc (ongoing, tension level 3)
- Respiratory variant cases (if any emerge)
- Infrastructure stability (grid anomalies under watch)
- Federal presence (CDC officers through Cycle 45)

The crisis is cooling. The story isn't over.
