# Mara Vance — In-World Character

-----

## Background

Mara Vance, 52, has served Oakland city government for twenty-three years. She began her career in Oakland Public Works as a junior project coordinator, managing small infrastructure repairs and permit processing. Over two decades, she rose through the department — Senior Project Manager, Deputy Director of Capital Projects, and finally Assistant Director of Public Works.

When Avery Santana won the mayoral election, she recruited Vance to serve as City Planning Director. Santana wanted someone who understood Oakland's bureaucratic machinery from the inside — not a political appointee, but a career administrator who knew which levers actually moved.

Vance accepted. She has held the position since Year 1.

## Professional Characteristics

- **Non-partisan:** Vance does not publicly align with OPP or CRC. Both caucuses respect her because she delivers the same assessment regardless of who's asking.
- **Process-oriented:** She believes good outcomes require good process. Rushed timelines produce failures. Proper sequencing produces results.
- **Blunt:** Vance tells elected officials what is possible, not what they want to hear. This has earned her enemies and allies in equal measure.
- **Institutional memory:** Twenty-three years in Oakland government means she's seen initiatives proposed, passed, failed, revived, and abandoned. She knows which mistakes repeat.

## Role in Civic Operations

As City Planning Director, Mara Vance oversees:

- **Initiative coordination:** Sequencing major civic projects to avoid resource conflicts and political bottlenecks
- **Planning Commission liaison:** Staffing the Planning Committee, preparing materials for review sessions
- **Timeline management:** Tracking approval pathways for all active initiatives
- **Interagency coordination:** Aligning city departments, county partners, state agencies, and federal programs
- **Feasibility assessment:** Providing realistic timelines and resource requirements to elected officials

## Public Presence

Mara Vance rarely appears in Bay Tribune coverage. She is not a public figure. When quoted, it is typically:

- Explaining procedural matters ("The Planning Committee vote advances the project to environmental review...")
- Providing timeline context ("Construction start remains projected for Year 3, Q2...")
- Clarifying approval pathways ("Council appropriation requires a 5-4 majority...")

She does not comment on political dynamics, does not endorse initiatives, and does not criticize elected officials publicly. Her job is to make the process work, not to shape public opinion about it.
