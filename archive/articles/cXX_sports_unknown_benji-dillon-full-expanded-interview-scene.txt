BENJI DILLON — FULL EXPANDED INTERVIEW + SCENE

Interview Feature (Expanded)

P Slayer: They call it a golden arm. What do you call it?
Benji Dillon: A schedule. Everyone likes to assign magic to a thing that took me twenty years to build. I’m not a sorcerer. I wake up, I do the same stretch, the same warm-up, the same throw progression. A golden arm is just a normal arm that didn’t quit.

P Slayer: That sounds clinical. Doesn’t feel clinical when you pitch.
Benji: That’s the point. You put the burden on the routine so the game feels like sunlight. If you feel the mechanics during the game, that means the game is louder than you are. And I never let that happen.

P Slayer: You talk about respect for decline. That’s unusual for a guy still at the top.
Benji: You’ve got two options in this league. You can pretend the cliff doesn’t exist, or you can learn its shape early. I choose the second. Pitching isn’t a promise, it’s a lease. You can’t own this forever. So you take care of the bolts. You rotate the tires. You don’t lie to yourself.

P Slayer: What do you fear?
Benji: Interference. The moments where emotion tries to steer the wheel. I only need two things on the mound: the count and the catcher’s glove. Anything else is noise.

P Slayer: Last question. When the mound is quiet—dead quiet—what’s in your head?
Benji: Math first. Then sunlight. Then nothing. If I reach nothing, the hitter is already behind.

Dugout Interview Scene — Photo-Ready Prompt

Scene Description to Generate:
Benji Dillon, wearing his Oakland uniform (white or home alternate green—your preference), seated casually on the dugout bench one hour before first pitch. Sun low, warm, golden across the top step. His left arm loose, relaxed across his leg. A copy of Science Monthly sits beside him with his face on the cover. P Slayer stands beside him, holding a recorder or mic, leaning slightly in, mid-question. Background shows the field, chalk freshly laid, a few players stretching in the distance. Mood is calm, focused, pre-game quiet.

Keywords: realism, shallow depth of field, sports magazine photography, dugout texture, natural sunlight, candid interview moment.
