“The Paulson Question: What Oakland’s Front Office Won’t Say About Chicago”
The Athletics won 105 games in 2040. They swept Houston in the ALDS. They pushed Boston to at least five games in the ALCS with a roster featuring a returning Cy Young winner, an MVP, and the deepest farm system in baseball.
And in the middle of it all, their General Manager was reportedly interviewing for a basketball job.
I’ve spent three weeks requesting comment from the front office about Mike Paulson’s reported talks with the Chicago Bulls. Three weeks of “no comment,” “we don’t discuss personnel matters,” and one particularly memorable “Mike is focused on winning a championship.”
Except he wasn’t focused enough to deny it.
Here’s what we know: Multiple league sources—not rumors, not speculation, but actual executives with knowledge of the conversations—confirmed Paulson was approached during the playoff push. The Bulls are rebuilding. They want a proven winner with cross-sport analytics experience. Paulson has built a dynasty in Oakland using data-driven player development and cost-controlled roster construction.
Here’s what we don’t know: Whether ownership approved the conversations. Whether Paulson asked permission. Whether the performance of the front office during the ALCS—specifically the decision to carry Benji Dillon at $24M instead of allocating resources elsewhere—was influenced by a GM already planning his exit.
I’m not saying Paulson tanked the season. I’m saying a front office’s attention is a finite resource, and we deserve to know if ours was divided.
The organization has forty-eight hours to respond to specific questions submitted to their media relations department. If they decline, that’s an answer too.
