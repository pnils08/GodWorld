“PAULSON IS GONE AND THEY’RE BURNING IT ALL DOWN: THE RECEIPTS”
OK SO EVERYONE SAID I WAS CRAZY ABOUT THE PAULSON CONSPIRACY BUT LOOK AT WHAT JUST HAPPENED:
NOVEMBER 10TH — THE COLES TRADE:
	•	We trade away: George Whiteley (#13 prospect), Agustin Rodriguez (CAREER YEAR), Cy Newell (literally saved our season), Peter Busch
	•	We get: Travis Coles (21yo ace, 94 overall)
THEY CALLED IT DESPERATE. THEY WERE RIGHT.
NOVEMBER 24TH — THE TAVARES SIGNING:
	•	7 YEARS, $32.1M PER YEAR for Eric Tavares (2B)
	•	He hit .237 last year
	•	SEVEN. YEARS.
FEBRUARY 15TH — THE MCCRACKEN DISASTER:
	•	Trade Allen Lopez (bad year, fine) AND Antonio Castro (CAREER YEAR)
	•	Get: Jeremy McCracken (33yo lefty, 9-14, 3.81 ERA)
	•	EVERYONE IS ASKING: WHY NOT JUST BRING BACK BENJI DILLON FOR $12.5M???
FEBRUARY 22ND — THE CLOSER SWAP:
	•	Trade Edmundo Peña (our 5x All-Star closer), Ross Cabral, Reggie McGregor
	•	Get: Mariano Rosales (26yo, unproven)
	•	Peña had 42 saves, 4 blown. Rosales had 38 saves, 5 blown. WE TRADED THE BETTER CLOSER.
THE MANAGER SITUATION:
	•	Mike Kindler’s contract expired (105-57 season, lost ALCS)
	•	We hire DEACON SEYMOUR — WHO HAS NEVER MANAGED A GAME
	•	3 years, $7.6M per year
	•	FOR A TEAM FULL OF VETERANS IN A CHAMPIONSHIP WINDOW
THEORY: Paulson is leaving. He KNOWS he’s leaving. So he’s making massive moves that look like “win-now” but are actually “burn it down and leave before anyone realizes what happened.”
The Coles trade? Desperate. The McCracken trade? Inexplicable. The Tavares contract? FRANCHISE-CRIPPLING.
And where is Paulson right now? IN CHICAGO HAVING DINNER WITH BULLS PLAYERS.
Connect. The. Dots.
