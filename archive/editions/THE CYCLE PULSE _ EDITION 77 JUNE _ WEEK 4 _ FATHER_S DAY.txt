STABILIZATION FUND SURVIVES COMMITTEE HEARING; FLOOR VOTE NEXT CYCLE

Harris testimony anchors emotional proceedings; CRC raises procedural concerns but signals no blocking motion

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund cleared its committee hearing last night in a session that ran past midnight, setting up a floor vote next cycle with the same math that’s defined the debate from the start: six votes needed, four confirmed.

Javier Harris, 57, an electrician who’s lived in West Oakland for thirty years, delivered testimony that brought the chamber quiet.

“I’m not here to talk about policy,” Harris said. “I’m here because three families on my block packed trucks this year. I watched them go. The fund won’t bring them back. But my neighbors who stayed — they’re watching this vote.”

Harris described arriving in Oakland in 1995, buying a house in 1998, raising two children who attended local schools. He named specific addresses on his street that have turned over in the past three years — 1847 Filbert, 1852 Filbert, 1859 Filbert.

“That’s three houses,” Harris said. “Three families I knew. Gone.”

The committee heard testimony from organizations on both sides. Denise Washington, 52, executive director of the West Oakland Neighborhood Association, supported the fund with specific displacement data from her organization’s surveys.

“We’re losing forty families a month from this neighborhood,” Washington said. “Forty. The fund is triage. It’s not a cure. But you can’t perform surgery if the patient bleeds out first.”

Raymond Torres, 48, representing the Bay Area Tenants Union, testified that the legal services component alone could prevent two hundred evictions annually based on similar programs in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The opposition centered on fiscal concerns. Gerald Hoffman, 61, president of the Oakland Taxpayers Coalition, questioned the reserve draw mechanism.

“Twenty-eight million from reserves sounds responsible until you look at what those reserves are for,” Hoffman said. “Emergency infrastructure. Public safety contingencies. We’re one earthquake away from needing every dollar in that fund.”

The CRC caucus raised procedural questions but stopped short of a blocking motion. Warren Ashford asked for additional fiscal projections. Nina Chen requested a phased implementation analysis. Elliott Crane, participating remotely, questioned enforcement mechanisms for the landlord grant program.

Council President Ramon Vega, who presided, called the hearing “thorough” and scheduled the floor vote for next cycle.

Councilwoman Denise Carter, the fund’s primary sponsor, spoke after the hearing.

“We heard from the people who live this every day,” Carter said. “Now we vote.”

The math remains unchanged: four confirmed yes votes from the progressive bloc, two needed from the remaining five. Vega has signaled support in principle. Leonard Tran remains genuinely undecided. The CRC caucus has not indicated any member will cross over.

OPOA LAUNCHES DISTRICT 4 PRESSURE CAMPAIGN OVER ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE

Mailers hit Adams Point mailboxes; Ramirez schedules town hall in Vega’s district

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

The political fight over the Oakland Alternative Response Initiative arrived in District 4 mailboxes this week.

Glossy mailers from the Oakland Police Officers Association reached residents in Adams Point, Lake Merritt, and Grand Lake — Council President Ramon Vega’s district — warning of “cuts to public safety” and urging residents to “call your councilmember.”

OPOA President Vincent Ramirez announced a town hall scheduled for next month in Adams Point, directly targeting Vega’s constituency.

“We want residents to understand what this proposal actually does,” Ramirez said. “Eight million dollars moved out of public safety. That’s not reallocation. That’s a cut.”

The OARI initiative, announced last cycle by Mayor Avery Santana, would deploy civilian responders to mental health crises, wellness checks, and non-violent calls currently handled by police. The $8.2 million comes from OPD overtime budget — not officer salaries or patrol staffing — but the distinction hasn’t slowed the union’s messaging.

Miguel King, 48, a warehouse worker in Adams Point, received the mailer.

“I don’t know what to think,” King said. “The flyer says crime is up and they’re cutting police. But my neighbor’s kid had a mental health crisis last year and the cops who showed up didn’t know what to do. Maybe someone else should handle that.”

Vega’s office declined to comment on the pressure campaign. The council president’s position on OARI remains officially undecided.

The initiative requires a simple majority — five votes — with the council currently projected at four likely yes, two undecided, and three likely no. The vote is scheduled for Cycle 82.

AITKEN TO ATTEND STABILIZATION VOTE; BAYLIGHT HEARING ALSO ON AGENDA

A’s association representative expands civic engagement

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

Mark Aitken, the A’s third baseman who serves as an association representative for the MLBPA, confirmed he will attend next cycle’s Stabilization Fund floor vote.

Aitken was a significant influence in the Baylight District negotiations, representing player interests in discussions about the proposed stadium development. His attendance at the fund vote signals continued engagement with Oakland civic affairs beyond the baseball-specific portfolio.

“I live here,” Aitken said when asked about attending. “These decisions affect my neighbors.”

Aitken will also attend the Baylight District hearing, where his involvement is more directly relevant. The stadium project remains on track for its Cycle 83 vote.

No word on whether Mike Paulson, the A’s general manager who also serves as Bulls GM, plans to attend either proceeding. Paulson has been traveling between Oakland and Chicago as the Bulls push through their playoff positioning.

TRANSFORMER HICCUP CAUSES BRIEF UPTOWN OUTAGE

Power restored within forty minutes; no injuries reported

By Trevor Shimizu | Transit & Infrastructure

A transformer issue in Uptown caused a forty-minute power outage affecting roughly three hundred customers yesterday afternoon.

PG&E crews responded and restored service by 4:15 PM. The cause is under investigation, but initial reports suggest equipment failure rather than grid overload.

Luis Mitchell, 52, a barista at a Chinatown café near the affected area, said customers waited out the outage on the sidewalk.

“Nobody panicked,” Mitchell said. “It’s Oakland. We’ve had worse.”

No traffic signals were affected. AC Transit reported no service disruptions.

DAVIS ON TRACK FOR SPRING TRAINING; “FEELING NEAR 100%”

MVP’s recovery timeline holds after ACL scare

By Anthony | Lead Sports Journalist

Darren Davis is running again.

The A’s centerfielder, who missed playoff time last season with an ACL sprain, confirmed he’s on track for spring training involvement after completing rehabilitation work at the team facility.

“Feeling near 100%,” Davis said. “The knee’s responding. No setbacks. I’ll be ready.”

Davis won the 2040 MVP despite the injury-shortened season, leading the league in home runs (38) and slugging percentage (.575). The ACL scare in September — initially feared to be a tear — limited his postseason impact as the A’s fell to Boston in seven games in the ALCS.

The 2041 rotation is set: Rivas, Ramos, Coles, Ellis, Dillon. The lineup, assuming Davis returns to form, projects as one of the deepest in baseball.

Spring training opens with a series against San Diego.

RIVAL GM: “PAULSON’S SEYMOUR HIRE WILL BE HIS UNDOING”

Anonymous executive questions rookie manager selection for championship window

By Anthony | Lead Sports Journalist

An unnamed general manager from a rival organization told multiple outlets this week that Mike Paulson’s decision to hire Deacon Seymour as manager “will be his As undoing.”

Seymour, 38, has never managed a major league game. The A’s hired him on a three-year, $7.6 million annual contract after Mike Kindler’s departure following three consecutive ALDS exits.

“You’ve got veterans who’ve won six titles under Fisher-era management,” the anonymous GM said. “Now you hand them to a guy who’s never filled out a lineup card in the majors? In a championship window? That’s bold. Maybe too bold.”

Paulson has not responded to the criticism. Seymour addressed the inexperience question during his introductory presser.

“I’ve been around this game my whole life,” Seymour said at the time. “I know what these players need. I know what this city expects.”

The A’s finished 105-57 last season before the ALCS loss. The championship window, built around Davis, Rivas, and the newly acquired Travis Coles, remains open.

BULLS CRUISE PAST PACERS; TREPAGNIER LEADS ROY RACE

103-76 win extends best record in East; Giddey adds 20 and 15 assists

By Selena Grant | Bulls Beat

CHICAGO — The Bulls dismantled Indiana 103-76 on Wednesday, their most complete performance of the season.

Hank Trepagnier led the way with 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 8 assists. Josh Giddey added 20 points and 15 assists. Adash Stanley contributed 9 points, 6 rebounds, and 10 assists despite shooting 1-for-10 from three.

“We’re clicking,” Giddey said. “Everyone knows their role. Everyone’s buying in.”

The Bulls sit 33-14, best in the Eastern Conference. Trepagnier leads the Rookie of the Year conversation with season averages of 16.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 5.4 assists. Stanley projects fifth in both ROY voting and Sixth Man of the Year. Matas Buzelis sits third in Most Improved Player voting.

Injury updates: Tre Jones (broken left ankle) and Buzelis (pinched nerve, back) remain on track for returns in three to four weeks.

Chicago’s transformation under Paulson has been the league’s best story. A team that traded away Vucevic, Derozan, and Coby White before the season now leads the conference with a core averaging 24 years old.

CHICAGO SNAPSHOT: FATHER’S DAY WEEKEND

66°F, Clear | Pride Month continues | Bulls momentum building

By Talia Finch | Chicago Ground

The lakefront filled with families this weekend. Father’s Day brought crowds to Millennium Park, Navy Pier, and the riverwalk. Pride Month visibility continues in Boystown, where rainbow flags line Halsted Street.

Wei Thomas, 59, an acupuncturist in Chinatown, brought his adult son to dim sum Sunday morning.

“He lives in Schaumburg now,” Thomas said. “We used to do this every week when he was a kid. Now it’s twice a year. But it still feels the same.”

The Bulls’ success has energized the city in a way that surprises longtime residents. Derek Turner, 45, a grocery store owner in Chinatown, remembers the last time Chicago felt this way about basketball.

“Not since Rose,” Turner said. “Maybe not since Jordan. These kids are different. They play like they don’t know they’re supposed to lose.”

TEMESCAL FESTIVAL DRAWS FAMILIES FOR THIRD ANNUAL CELEBRATION

Father-Child games, BBQ, and music in the park

By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison

TEMESCAL — The third annual Father-Child Festival filled the park with laughter, smoke, and the sound of kids winning games their fathers let them win.

Shawn Johnson, 49, a mover who lives in Temescal, brought his twelve-year-old daughter to the three-legged race.

“She’s faster than me now,” Johnson said, catching his breath after they finished third. “I told her I let her set the pace. She knows I’m lying.”

The festival featured a BBQ competition, live music from local acts, and a silent auction benefiting Temescal youth programs. Organizers estimated attendance at roughly two thousand.

Christopher Walker, 34, a mechanic who was quoted in last cycle’s letters section, returned with his kids.

“Last year we came for the food,” Walker said. “This year my son wanted to enter the BBQ contest. He’s nine. His ribs were terrible. But he’s proud of them.”

The festival reflects Temescal’s recovery from the elevated health indicators that triggered concern earlier this year. The neighborhood’s sentiment readings have stabilized, and events like this suggest community bonds remain strong even as the Health Center vote approaches.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

ON THE STABILIZATION FUND:

I’ve lived in West Oakland since 1988. I watched the neighborhood empty out in the crack years. I watched it come back. Now I’m watching it empty out again, only this time it’s not drugs — it’s money. People with money moving in. People without money moving out.

The fund won’t fix that. But it might slow it down. That’s worth something.

— Ernesto Harris, 60, Brooklyn, Plumber

-----

ON FATHER’S DAY:

My father worked at the port for forty-two years. Never missed a day. Never complained. He’s been gone three years now, but every Father’s Day I go to the waterfront and watch the cranes move. That’s where he taught me what work looked like.

To all the fathers out there: your kids are watching. Make it count.

— Shawn Carter, 54, Jack London, Mover

-----

ON THE ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE INITIATIVE:

I got the OPOA mailer. It scared me, honestly. Then I thought about my nephew, who has schizophrenia. Last time he had an episode, the cops showed up. Five of them. For a guy talking to himself in a backyard.

Maybe eight million dollars for people who know what they’re doing isn’t such a bad idea.

— Marco Brown, 42, Downtown, Nurse Aide
