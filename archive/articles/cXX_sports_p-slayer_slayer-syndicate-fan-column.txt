The Fire Beneath the Green
Oakland, California — March 2040
The city still smells like rain and diesel when the gates open on Opening Day.  Vendors shout names, seagulls circle over left field, and the old Coliseum hums like it’s remembering every cheer that ever bounced off its concrete bones.  Oakland doesn’t need fireworks to announce baseball; the crowd is its own thunder.  And this year, the noise feels different — not nostalgic, not desperate — just alive.
Look at that rotation and you’ll understand why.  Henry Rivas, the ninety-one overall ace, carries himself like a man who’s seen both parades and rebuilds and still believes the next pitch matters most.  Arturo Ramos, eighty-six overall, throws like he’s tired of being polite.  Allen Lopez, the quiet eighty-four, will outlast you by repetition alone.  Benji Dillon, eighty-two overall and back in green and gold, stands on the mound with a calm that only champions earn.  And then there’s John Ellis — The Quiet Storm, eighty overall, the kid who turned potential into presence overnight.  Five arms, one heartbeat.  No imported savior.  Just the city, distilled into leather and willpower.
Around them, the lineup feels like a memory refusing to fade.  Mark Aitken still owns the corner; Isley Kelley still makes grounders disappear; Danny Horn and Peter Busch still run down fly balls like they owe someone rent.  Darrin Davis, the outlaw from Ohio, still swings like the season depends on it.  They’ve all grown older, but that’s the beauty of it — so has Oakland.  The fans don’t want perfection; they want fight.  They want to see men who understand that survival here means everything.
I stood outside the park before the anthem, watching a kid in a cracked Vinnie Keane jersey paint his face green.  His dad handed him a marker and said, “We still got fire, right?”  The boy nodded like it was gospel.  That’s what this season feels like — faith without the ceremony, pride without the polish.  A city still burning under all that green.
So let the world talk about payrolls and dynasties past.  Out here, the dynasty never died — it just learned to work the late shift.  The fire beneath the green still burns, and it’s ready to light up the night again.
