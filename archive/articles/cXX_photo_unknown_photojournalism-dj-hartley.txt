PHOTOJOURNALISM — DJ Hartley

STILL LIFE: FIVE PHOTOGRAPHS FROM A QUIET OAKLAND MORNING

A bus easing up to the curb on MacArthur.
A baker sliding trays into the display case.
A jogger cutting through Lake Merritt fog.
A street vendor setting up before the sun pushes through.
A mother tying her kid’s jacket at the school gate.

Nothing dramatic.
Everything true.
