FAITH & FRAME — Elliot Graye

STILLNESS AND THE SACRED SPACE BETWEEN WEEKS

Local congregations described this as a “week of balance.” No emergencies pulling leaders away from their usual schedules. No surges in community needs. Just the predictable flow of prayer groups, youth programs, and evening services.

For many spiritual leaders, weeks like this are essential — time to breathe, reflect, and prepare for what’s next in a city where calm isn’t guaranteed.
