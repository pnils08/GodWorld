# Sports Desk — Editorial Memory

Last Updated: 2026-02-17 | First edition with memory: pending

## A's Roster Notes
- **Mark Aitken**: 1B (NOT 3B — this was wrong in base_context.json and caused E82 errors). Verify against TrueSource.
- **Darrin Davis**: DH (NOT 2B). Age 33 at injury (Paulson ruling from Session 34 archive raid).
- **Benji Dillon**: Exactly 5 Cy Youngs confirmed (Paulson ruling).
- **Cy Newell**: Right-handed (Paulson ruling, TrueSource wins over old articles).
- **John Ellis**: Age 24 (TrueSource).
- Always verify player positions against Oakland_Sports_Feed and TrueSource before writing.

## Warriors Notes
- Record needs to be added to Oakland_Sports_Feed (pending from Session 36).

## Fan Characters Quoted
- Update after each edition with fans quoted in sports articles.

## Corrections Applied
- E82: Aitken listed as 3B, should be 1B. Davis position wrong. Gold Glove at DH was nonsensical (DH doesn't field).
- Lesson: Don't trust base_context.json positions blindly. Cross-reference.

## Coverage Notes
- P Slayer: first person, emotional, "we" voice. NEVER analyst voice.
- Anthony: third person, insider, long sentences with evidence. NEVER dashboard language.
- Hal: first person reflective, history-aware. Used sparingly.
