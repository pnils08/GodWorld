ELLIOT GRAYE — Faith Essays
“The Theology of Almost: What Job Knew About the 2040 Athletics”
Job lost everything—children, wealth, health—and still believed. His friends told him he must have sinned. He told them they didn’t understand how faith works in the face of inexplicable loss.
Oakland lost Darrin Davis twice, Vladimir Gonzalez for months, Danny Horn to an MCL sprain in September. They won 105 games anyway. They believed anyway. And then they lost the ALCS to Boston.
Almost is a theological category, not a baseball one.
The Book of Job doesn’t end with restoration because God feels bad. It ends with restoration because Job’s faith survives the not-knowing. He never learns why the suffering happened. He just learns to live in the presence of mystery.
Oakland’s faithful—the season ticket holders, the Fruitvale candle-lighters, the kids in Ernesto Quintero jerseys—spent October living in the presence of almost. Almost healthy. Almost deep enough. Almost champions again.
The test of faith is not whether you believe when you win. The test is whether you believe when you don’t understand why you lost.
I watched the final ALCS game at a bar in Temescal. Thirty people in green and gold. When the last out came, no one moved. Someone said, “Next year.” Someone else said, “We gave everything.” A woman in an Isley Kelley jersey just shook her head and walked out.
That woman might never come back. Or she might show up Opening Day 2041 with the same jersey and the same hope. Both responses are faithful.
Job’s friends wanted explanation. Job wanted presence. Oakland’s season ended without explanation—Darrin’s injuries, the timing, the collapse. But presence remains. The team remains. The city remains.
Almost is where faith lives.
