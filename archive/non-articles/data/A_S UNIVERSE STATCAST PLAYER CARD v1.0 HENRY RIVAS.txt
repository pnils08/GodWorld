PITCHING REPERTOIRE — SAVANT INTERPRETATION

2-Seam Fastball — 94 mph
• Great arm-side run
• His best early-count strike pitch
• Used to induce soft contact

Sinker — 90 mph

• Primary groundball generator
• Excellent vs LHB inside

12–6 Curveball — 75 mph
• His signature pitch
• Extreme vertical action
• Generates freeze strikes & late chase
• 70-grade shape when sharp

Circle Change — 78 mph
• Speed differential is massive
• Right-on-left weapon
• Produces rollover grounders

Slider — 80 mph

• Good for mixing; not a kill pitch

Summary:
This is a deep, old-school five-pitch mix with modern movement profiles.
Rivas doesn’t overpower — he out-executes hitters.

RUN PREVENTION & ERA PATTERN

Recent ERA pattern (TrueSource):
2039: 3.84
2038: 3.39
2037: 3.18
2036: 4.65
2035: 3.13
2034: 2.21

Career ERA: 3.48
This is the profile of a high-end SP2 with SP1 peaks when the curveball is sharp.

⸻

ROLE & WORKLOAD

STA 80 = reliable innings
• 180+ IP every healthy season
• 30+ starts yearly
• Does not require heavy bullpen support

He is the stabilizer of a rotation.

⸻

DEFENSE

Fielding: 91 (elite)
Arm Accuracy: 58
Reaction: 58

This is extremely rare for a pitcher.
He fields his position like a shortstop—great on comebackers, bunts, and slow rollers.

⸻

DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY

At 28 years old, Rivas is the perfect “prime window” pitcher:
• VEL 91 → stable
• BRK 74 → high-level pitch movement
• CTRL 75 → plus command
• PCLT 76 → limits mistake-zone misses

Projected aging curve:
• No major decline until age 32–33
• Maintains control & break longer than velocity

Contract (5 years @ $28.2M) is a steal for his production.

⸻

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Rivas is quietly one of the most efficient pitchers in the league.
• His H/9 + BB/9 combination is the golden ratio for stability.
• The 12–6 curveball is his true separator — Statcast-style shape is elite.
• The slider is shallow; if it develops, his strikeouts will spike.
• Projection: Top 20 SP in baseball by underlying metrics.

⸻

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“Rivas doesn’t look dangerous — then he carves you for seven innings.
Every. Damn. Time.
He’s the quiet killer in the rotation.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Rivas belongs to the forgotten lineage of command-first pitchers who create longevity through intellect.
He reads bats the way great writers read crowds.”
