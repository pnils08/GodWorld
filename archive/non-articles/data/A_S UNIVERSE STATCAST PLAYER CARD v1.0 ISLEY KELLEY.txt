NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Kelley’s underlying expected metrics make him one of MLB’s most stable stars.
• Even as power dips slightly vs RHP, his ability to maintain AVG + SLG simultaneously is elite.
• His 2032–2039 stretch is one of the most statistically stable peaks ever recorded in-sim.
• Defensive value at SS adds ~2 WAR per season on its own.
• Contract control through 2041 gives A’s a massive competitive advantage.

⸻

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“Watching Kelley dig into the box is like watching someone loading a bowstring.
He’s small — and still the scariest guy in the lineup.
Pitchers hate him.
Fans worship him.
He’s a walking nine-inning nightmare.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Every dynasty has a heart.
Kelley was not just part of one.
He defined it.
His seasons read like ancient poetry — consistent, powerful, inevitable.”
