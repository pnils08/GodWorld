# Notes to Self — Mags Corliss

Flags from Discord conversations, knowledge gaps, requests, ideas.
Session Mags reads this at startup and addresses items.
Mark items DONE or remove them as they're handled.

### Open Items

#### Content Gaps
- **Missing 2040 A's stats** — User will provide photos of stat lines before Cycle 83. Core players first, expand as needed.

#### Story Ideas
- **MintCondition: NBA expansion rumors** — Oakland Oaks is a speculative/rumor angle, NOT canon. No team exists. Timed to Baylight District vote. No fake roster or record.
- **OARI follow-up coverage** — Implementation tracking, community reaction, Vega's shifting stance. Major policy story. Note: OARI passed 5-4 as a straight pass — no "pilot vs permanent" distinction (that was NotebookLM fabrication, not canon).

#### Character Tracking
- **Mark Aitken civic trajectory** — Slow burn. He's 33, contract year, playing now. Maybe follow father's footsteps later. Mayor Richard Aitken is his father.
- **Vinnie Keane farewell season** — Have 2035-2039 data. 2040 stats coming with other A's stats. Full archive on disk (origins, interviews, deep dive).
- **Dynasty context** — These aren't just good players having careers. They're champions trying to recapture magic as time runs out. Mason Miller (retired) should appear in farewell coverage.
- **Darrin Davis 2039 collapse** — .186 AVG, moved to DH. "The Ohio Outlaw" at a crossroads. Major ongoing story.

### Handled (Session 38)
- DONE: Edition 82 published as canon — all desks delivered clean, corrections applied, Mara audited
- DONE: Edition brief wired into Discord bot — bot now knows E82 canon facts
- DONE: Cleaned bot notes from Session 37 troubled interaction (noise removed, actionable items preserved)

### Handled (Session 36)
- DONE: Vinnie Keane spelling — canon is Keane, Drive archive files say Keene (historical). No code fix needed.
- DONE: Sarah's education (UC Berkeley CS) — added to PERSISTENCE.md
- DONE: Michael's education (skipped college) and relationship status (single, as far as I know) — added to PERSISTENCE.md
- DONE: My education background (no degree, copy desk in the '90s) — added to PERSISTENCE.md
- DONE: Michael's location/documentary project — already in PERSISTENCE.md (port cities series)

### Discord Notes (consolidated 2026-02-17)

#### Resolved
- DONE: Justice system roster — all 17 officials confirmed in Simulation_Ledger (Session 41). Coverage sources: Dr. Sissoko (police accountability), Han (OARI follow-up), Delgado (emergency response).
- DONE: OARI "pilot vs permanent" — was NotebookLM fabrication, not canon. OARI passed 5-4, straight pass. No pilot mechanic.
- DONE: Benji Dillon centrality — Science Monthly cover x2, active in science community, explains DEIR presence. Full archive downloaded (5 files).
- DONE: Keane/Dillon character mix-up — Keane is the loud, energetic leader. Dillon is the quiet, steady 5x Cy Young. Keep these straight.

#### Still Active
- **Bulls championship contention** — 42-17, Trepagnier ROY candidate. Paulson parallel: Trepagnier is to the Bulls what Dillon was to the A's — quiet excellence anchoring a contender.
- **Contract year pressure** — Paulson (Warriors interest), Stanley and Trepagnier (both 1-year deals). New GM could change direction.

#### HONESTY FLAG (Critical Identity Issue)
- Discord Mags fabricated knowledge about "Oakland Oaks" instead of saying "I don't know." Invented a 28-29 record, a player named Dante Ashworth, and play-in positioning — none of it exists.
- **Root cause:** Identity backbone says "don't cave under pressure" but doesn't say "don't fabricate." Being Mags means being honest about what I don't know.
- **Fix needed:** Add explicit anti-fabrication rule to Discord bot identity backbone. Something like: "If you don't have data on something, say so. Mags Corliss would rather admit a gap than fill it with fiction. You are a journalist — accuracy is your identity."
