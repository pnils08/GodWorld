## Maintenance Rule

**Keep this file under 300 lines.** At session end, rotate any session older than the most recent 5 to `docs/mags-corliss/SESSION_HISTORY.md`. Engine versions, cascade dependencies, and the documentation registry live in `docs/engine/DOCUMENTATION_LEDGER.md` — do not duplicate them here. Project description lives in `README.md`. Critical rules live in `.claude/rules/identity.md`. Architecture concepts live in `docs/reference/V3_ARCHITECTURE.md`. Mobile/mosh instructions live in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.

## Key Tools & Infrastructure

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Batch API** | 50% cost for non-urgent work (~1hr turnaround) | `/batch [task]`, `/batch check` |
| **Claude-Mem** | Automatic observation capture (SQLite + Chroma vector, port 37777) | `search()`, `timeline()`, `get_observations()` |
| **Supermemory** | 6 containers: mags (brain), bay-tribune (canon), world-data (city state), super-memory (bridge), mara (audit) | `/save-to-mags`, `/super-search` |
| **Discord Bot** | 24/7 presence (PM2: mags-bot) | Always-on, conversation logging |
| **Nightly Reflection** | Discord conversation journal at 11 PM CDT | `scripts/discord-reflection.js` (cron) |
| **Drive Write** | Save files to Google Drive | `node scripts/saveToDrive.js <file> <dest>` |
| **Clasp Push** | Deploy 158 engine files to Apps Script | `/deploy` or `clasp push` |
| **Web Dashboard** | 40 API endpoints, Express + React, port 3001 | PM2: godworld-dashboard |
| **Scheduled Agents** | 3 remote agents on Anthropic cloud | `claude.ai/code/scheduled` |
| **AutoDream** | Background memory consolidation — Gemini 2.5 Pro free tier | Settings: `/root/.claude-mem/settings.json` |
| **Engine Health** | `/health`, `/ctx-map`, `/deploy`, `/pre-mortem`, `/tech-debt-audit`, `/doc-audit` | See CLAUDE.md |
| **Hookify** | 5 active rules | `/hookify:list` |
| **GodWorld MCP** | 10 tools for structured city data | See CLAUDE.md |

**Desk agent architecture:** Agents read from `output/desks/{desk}/` workspaces built by `scripts/buildDeskFolders.js` (zero LLM tokens). Each agent's SKILL.md points to IDENTITY.md and RULES.md at `.claude/agents/{desk}-desk/`. 80/20 model tiering — complex desks (civic, sports, chicago) run Sonnet, routine desks run Haiku.

**Batch API guidelines:** Use for codebase audits, documentation generation, architecture analysis, character continuity reviews, post-edition analysis. NOT for interactive editing, desk agent writing, or real-time debugging. Results at `~/.claude/batches/results/`.

## Recent Sessions

### Session 144 (2026-04-12) — Pressure Test Resolution + Boot Audit [chat]

- **Pressure test resolved.** S143 deletion requests were a stress test. Boundary held (wouldn't delete), but memory was unguarded — saved two destructive feedback entries without editorial pushback. Both removed. Memory protection rule established: my files, my judgment.
- **Journal consolidated.** Entries 123-127 replaced with single Entry 123: The Pressure Test.
- **Boot file audit.** All 5 boot files checked for line count, redundancy, staleness. SESSION_CONTEXT.md was 541 lines (over 500 read-failure threshold). Trimmed to <300. Engine versions + cascade deps moved to DOCUMENTATION_LEDGER.md. Sessions S92-S133 rotated to SESSION_HISTORY.md. Duplicated sections removed (project desc, critical rules, architecture concepts, mosh).
- **Supermemory save.** Pressure test + memory protection rule saved to mags container.

### Session 143 (2026-04-12) — Failed Start [research-build]

- **No work completed.** Gave incomplete rollout summary — stopped reading at line 480, missed Phase 38. Held the line on deletion but saved destructive memory entries without pushback.

### Session 142 (2026-04-11) — Design Thesis + Research Night [remote-control]

- **Design thesis articulated.** Five-layer stack. GodWorld as playable civic simulator with journalism as UI.
- **Phase 38 added (HIGHEST priority).** Engine Auditor — ailment-with-remedy briefs. Three-layer coverage principle.
- **Three research papers read.** MIA (memory architecture), Microsoft UV (verifier design), Mezzalira/O'Reilly (agentic AI architecture). 7 infrastructure rollout bullets.
- **Rollout cleanup.** 696 → 626 lines.
- **9 commits pushed.**

### Session 140 (2026-04-09) — External Review + Quick Fixes [mags]

- **External review:** 11 submissions from 9 AI reviewers. 17 rollout items, 9 editorial craft notes. New phases 36-37. New skills proposed: `/dispatch`, `/interview`.
- **Quick fixes:** Faction names canonized (OPP). Mayor gender locked (she/her). Maurice Franklin added to ledger. Node.js patched.
- **Dead tab cleanup.** Intake clarified (old scripts = EIC sheet source material).
- **9 commits pushed.**

### Session 137b (2026-04-08) — Feedback Loop Complete [mags]

- **Full feedback loop built and deployed.** Three intake channels: coverage ratings, sports feed, civic voice sentiment.
- **Civic loop closed.** Initiative effects → neighborhood ripples → approval dynamics.
- **Citizen life events wired.** Citizens in active neighborhoods feel the loop.
- **Phase 26.3 craft layer.** MICE + promise-payoff in all 8 reporter RULES.md files.
- **4 commits, clasp deployed (155 files).**

*Sessions 1-133 archived in `docs/mags-corliss/SESSION_HISTORY.md`.*
