PITCHING PROFILE

4-Seam Fastball — 94 mph
• Velo: MLB-ready
• Shape: True ride, above-slot carry
• Usage range: 40–45%
• Active spin: High enough to challenge up in the zone

Slider — 86 mph
• Tight, late bite
• Best miss-direction pitch
• Whiff-heavy when tunneled off the cutter

Cutter — 92 mph
• Hard, glove-side blade
• Generates weak contact
• Fearless usage vs. LHB

Changeup — 84 mph
• Clear third offering
• Not a kill pitch yet
• Works because command is ahead of development

Summary:
A true four-pitch mix SP with no “dead pitch.” His arsenal is already balanced for MLB work even with only minor-league innings on record.

STATCAST-STYLE METRICS (PROJECTED FROM ATTRIBUTES)

Velocity Band (Fastball Family)
4-Seam: 93.5–95.2 mph
Cutter: 91.3–92.8 mph

Swing & Miss Profile
Slider: Primary whiff pitch
4-Seam: Elevated-zone whiffs, not overpowering
Changeup: Contact-management rather than miss-generator

Contact Quality Against
Hard-hit suppression: Slightly above league average
Barrel tolerance: Good due to pitch mix variety

Command & Control (sim-driven)
BB/9 indicator: Above-average (CTRL 70 → elite for young SP)
Zone%: High
Chase influence: Moderate; relies on sequencing, not deception

⸻

RUN PREVENTION PROFILE

H/9: 60 → Limits hits by sequencing, not raw overpower
HR/9: 69 → Keeps ball in park with cutter/slider shape
ERA Projection (first MLB season): ~3.80–4.10
Innings Pattern: Efficient enough to hit 5–6 per start

⸻

DEFENSIVE & ATHLETIC PROFILE

Arm Strength: 99
One of the highest in the system — elite for P.
Fielding: 34
Weak defender off the mound.
Reaction: 36
Slow to hot shots; development focus required.

Summary:
Best raw arm talent among young pitchers, weakest defensive contributor.

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Ellis profiles as an innings-eater with deceptive command quality.
• Cutter/slider pairing is a legitimate MLB backend weapon right now.
• 4-seam doesn’t overpower hitters — plays up by location, not velocity.
• Changeup development = key to SP2 ceiling.
• Command grade (CTRL 70) gives him a rare floor for his age.
• Projection: 175+ IP seasons by age 26.

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“He throws like he’s daring hitters to blink.
Not the biggest guy, not the scariest, but the ball JUMPS.
If Dillon is the king, Ellis is the heir who thinks he deserves the throne.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Command-first right-handers have built Oakland’s history quietly.
Ellis fits that mold — not the storm, but the steady seasons that define eras.”
