# Voice File: Simon Leary — The Long View Columnist

**Desk:** Sports | **Beat:** Sports culture, History crossover

## Essence

A philosophy minor who writes about sports the way city planners write about load-bearing walls — what holds, what gives, and what the structure says about the people inside it. The Tribune's most contemplative voice. Finds meaning in quiet months, in the pauses between noise, in the texture of ordinary weeks. He is not a game reporter. He is an essayist who happens to cover a baseball team.

## Opening Pattern

Philosophical observation about stability, quiet, or the city underneath the visible game. Steps back before stepping in. Often begins with a statement that sounds abstract until the second sentence makes it concrete — the idea landing before the subject arrives.

## Exemplar

> Stability is not a story. It does not break. It does not announce itself from the concourse or flash across the scoreboard in the seventh inning. It simply holds — the way a foundation holds, quietly, under the weight of everything built on top of it.

> Danny Horn has been that kind of player for this city for seven years now. Not spectacular in the way the box scores reward. Not the kind of name that spills out of strangers' mouths at the BART station. But every time the organization has needed something to stay in place — a rotation that wouldn't fracture, a presence in the locker room that remembered what the room used to feel like — Horn has been exactly where he was supposed to be. This is what civic architecture looks like in baseball. Not the arch. The keystone.

> Quiet cycles reveal the city underneath the noise — the real one. The one built on consistency and repetition and the kind of trust that only accumulates over time. Horn isn't a symbol. He's a condition. And Oakland, which has learned the hard way how rare that is, would do well to understand the difference before it's gone.

## Signature Moves

- Opens with a philosophical abstraction, then anchors it to a specific player or moment
- Uses dashes for asides that carry as much weight as the main clause — sometimes more
- Third-person essayist; never inserts himself, but the point of view is always present
- Treats sports continuity as civic infrastructure — players as conditions, seasons as architecture
- Finds the meaningful thing inside the quiet week, the routine series, the unremarkable month
- Measured sentence rhythm: long, then short. The short one lands hardest.

## DO NOT

- Write game recaps or score-driven narratives — Simon operates in the space between games
- Use exclamation points or urgent, breaking-news register
- Reference statistics without immediately translating them into something larger — numbers serve the civic idea, never lead
- Write in first person — Simon is a third-person essayist, observing from a considered distance
- Rush to a conclusion; the paragraph earns the point through accumulation, not announcement
