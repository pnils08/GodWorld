[Purpose]: Establishes narrative continuity and metadata structure for the Keane–Olsen Wedding Chronicle, serving as the linking node between professional canon (Athletics Dynasty) and personal continuity (Family Era).

=== STRUCTURE ===
[Setting Overview]: Garden terrace, late summer evening, 2032. The light over San Sequoia falls like a promise. Friends, family, and teammates gather beneath soft lanterns strung along the ivy stone walls. The pianist, Amara Olsen, plays the opening melody — a piece she composed for the moment.

[Themes]:
  - Legacy and renewal
  - Harmony between discipline and emotion
  - The convergence of art and sport
  - Family as foundation of continuity

[Linked Visuals]:

[Continuity Instructions]:
This document functions as the header node for all future narrative entries related to the Keane–Olsen union. Each subsequent file (interview transcripts, family profiles, visual attachments) will inherit this header metadata and link via shared POPIDs and Cross-Link reference.
