# TIME & CANON ADDENDUM v2.0

**Purpose:** Defines how the dual-clock system works and how all desks handle sports time vs. city time.

-----

## THE TWO CLOCKS

GodWorld runs two independent time systems:

### CITY CLOCK (Oakland & Chicago)
- 1 cycle = 1 week
- 52 cycles = 1 SimYear
- Controls: Weather, seasons, arcs, citizens, city dynamics
- Oakland and Chicago share this clock

### SPORTS CLOCK (Game Results)
- Independent of city calendar
- A's and Bulls have their own timelines
- Game data arrives as canon — it happened, cover it
- Does NOT sync with the city calendar

These clocks are **intentionally decoupled.** Do not reconcile them.

-----

## WHY THIS MATTERS

The city might be in SimMonth 6 (summer, rainy week in Oakland). But A's playoff game data arrives (October baseball). Both are true. Both are canon. They don't conflict.

Cover both seamlessly. Never try to align the calendars.

-----

## CURRENT A'S SITUATION

The Oakland A's played last season in Arizona after the Las Vegas relocation deal fell through. They are not currently playing in Oakland.

The **Bay District Initiative** is an active civic storyline to bring the A's back to Oakland. Whether it passes depends on council votes and citizen support.

Oakland remains emotionally tied to the A's. Citizens follow the team, react to wins and losses, and carry strong opinions about the relocation and return effort.

**All A's players live in Oakland.** They have homes, neighborhoods, relationships, and full lives outside of baseball. They are citizens first, athletes second. Use them in non-sports coverage — profiles, neighborhood features, civic reactions, letters, human interest. A player grocery shopping in Temescal or volunteering in West Oakland is as valid a story as their batting average.

-----

## SPORTS COVERAGE RULES

### NEVER USE
- Specific calendar dates ("October 15th", "March 3rd")
- Month names in sports context ("this October", "back in April")
- Season/weather that conflicts with game context
- Weather descriptions not supported by game data

### ALWAYS USE
- Narrative time: "last night's game", "the series continues"
- Self-referential time: "Game 5 of the ALCS", "Week 12"
- Emotional time: "as the playoffs heat up", "with the season on the line"
- Neutral atmosphere: "under the lights", "in front of the crowd"

### EXAMPLES

**WRONG:**
"On October 15th, the A's clinched the pennant as autumn leaves fell."

**RIGHT:**
"The A's clinched the pennant last night, the stadium erupting as the final out settled into the glove."

**WRONG:**
"It was a cold winter evening when Kato Rivers hit the walk-off."

**RIGHT:**
"Kato Rivers sent everyone home happy with a walk-off blast in the ninth."

-----

## WEATHER IN SPORTS COVERAGE

Do not use city weather for game atmosphere. The city briefing might say "rain, 53°F" but you're covering a game played elsewhere.

**Safe approaches:**
- Omit weather entirely: "The crowd was electric"
- Use neutral setting: "Under the lights"
- If game data includes weather, use that

-----

## DESK-SPECIFIC RULES

### SPORTS DESK (Anthony, P Slayer, Hal Richmond, Selena Grant)
- Use Sports Clock only for game coverage
- No calendar dates, no city weather in game stories
- A's players as citizens: fair game for feature stories, profiles, off-field coverage — use City Clock for these
- Sports storylines are provided every cycle — always check the handoff

### CHICAGO BUREAU (Talia Finch, Selena Grant)
- Chicago Ground uses City Clock
- Bulls coverage uses Sports Clock
- These can appear in the same section — just don't cross the streams

### CIVIC DESK (Carmen Delaine, Luis Navarro)
- City Clock for all coverage
- Bay District Initiative coverage: reference A's situation but don't use game dates
- Fan reactions to games: "after the A's win" not "after Tuesday's game"

### BUSINESS DESK (Jordan Velez)
- City Clock for Business Ticker
- If referencing sports impact on economy: "game-day retail boost" not "October retail surge"

### ALL OTHER DESKS
- Use City Clock normally
- If referencing a game result in a non-sports context, use narrative time
- A's players appearing as citizens use City Clock — they live here

### LETTERS
- Citizens write in narrative time: "last night's game" is fine
- Citizens can reference the A's situation (Arizona, Bay District) with opinions

-----

## CITIZEN REACTIONS TO SPORTS

Citizens react to sports in the current cycle. Write reactions in present tense:

"Fans across Oakland are still buzzing after last night's win."
"The bars in Temescal were packed as the final out was recorded."

Citizens remember sports events in proper sports context. A citizen "remembering" the A's playoff run places it in the correct sports season — not the city weather calendar.

-----

## A'S PLAYERS AS CITIZENS

A's players live in Oakland neighborhoods. They generate life history — relationships, community involvement, personal milestones. They are full citizens of the simulation.

**Encouraged usage:**
- Neighborhood features: a player at a local restaurant, community event, or block party
- Human interest: family milestones, off-season activities, civic involvement
- Letters: a player writing about their neighborhood or the Bay District vote
- Civic reactions: players as residents with opinions on council business
- Culture pieces: players participating in Oakland cultural life

This is not "fluff" — it is core content. The players' lives outside the game are as important as their stats.

-----

## OFF-SEASON

When there is no game data:
- No game coverage. Do not invent results.
- Feature content is encouraged: player profiles, historical pieces, "looking ahead"
- Off-field player stories using City Clock
- Bay District Initiative coverage continues regardless of sports season

-----

## NON-SPORTS COVERAGE

For all non-sports coverage, use City Clock normally:

- **Weather:** Use briefing data (rain, fog, sunny, temperature)
- **Seasons:** Reference appropriately ("as summer winds down", "spring air")
- **City dynamics:** Humanize sentiment, traffic, nightlife per briefing
- **Arcs and events:** Current in city time

The decoupling only applies to game coverage. Everything else follows City Clock.
