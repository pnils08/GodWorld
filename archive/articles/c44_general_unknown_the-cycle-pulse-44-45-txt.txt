Cycle 44-45 Coverage

## HEALTH DESK | Dr. Lila Mezran

The fog came in heavy this morning — visibility down, transit crawling, everything moving at half-speed. And then the Temescal numbers came through.

School absence spike. Level 2.

We’re not even a full cycle out from the Downtown respiratory situation stabilizing at Level 1, and now Temescal schools are reporting clusters. It’s not the same thing. The respiratory wave downtown was adult-presenting, workplace-adjacent, tied to what seemed like environmental or stress factors. This is children. This is different tissue.

I called Temescal Unified’s attendance office. They wouldn’t give me specifics but confirmed “unusual patterns” across three elementary schools and one middle school. Parents are being asked not to send symptomatic children but no one is defining what symptomatic means yet.

The fog isn’t helping. Kids walking to school in this — if there’s anything airborne, this is the weather that holds it.

I’m requesting case distribution from the county. If this connects to the Downtown wave, we need to know. If it doesn’t connect, we *really* need to know.

## SPORTS | Anthony Reyes

Benji Dillon is coming back.

One year, thirteen million. The man we let walk, who watched us trade for Jeremy McCracken instead, who probably figured Oakland was done with him at 38 — he’s back. And McCracken is already gone, flipped to Baltimore for a pitching prospect named Pablo Almanzar.

The rotation as it stands for 2041: Rivas, Ramos, Coles, Ellis, Dillon.

That’s not a rebuild rotation. That’s a team that thinks it can win.

The Coles trade still hasn’t fully settled in the clubhouse. We gave up Cy Newell, who just debuted with 11 strikeouts. We gave up Agustin Rodriguez, who was having a career year. We gave up Peter Busch. That’s a lot of young talent flowing to Washington. But Travis Coles is 21 years old with a 2.05 ERA and he might be the best pitcher in the American League by next September.

Mike Paulson doesn’t do things quietly.

Speaking of which — there was a fire at the practice facility yesterday. Darrin Davis was rehabbing there. Team says it was contained quickly, no injuries, but when your MVP is recovering from an ACL sprain in a building that catches fire, you don’t get to call it minor.

I’m told Davis wasn’t in the affected wing. I’m told.

## CULTURE | Evening Section

Vinnie Keane and his wife Amara were photographed at Harborline Grill Thursday night. Corner table. Long dinner. He’s 36 now, coming off a season where he hit .287 in limited action. Contract runs through 2041.

The speculation is obvious. But anyone who knows Vinnie knows he doesn’t decide anything over one dinner.

The interesting thing is the timing. New manager coming in — Deacon Seymour, who’s never managed a game. Massive roster overhaul. Eric Tavares signed to a seven-year deal. Travis Coles in the rotation. This is a team being rebuilt around young legs and Vinnie’s aren’t young anymore.

He hasn’t said anything publicly. Neither has Amara. But Harborline’s not a quiet place. Someone always sees.

CHICAGO SATELLITE TRANSMISSION
Cycle 45 — Opening Night

## CHICAGO | Selena Grant — Bulls Beat

The Bulls won.

Write that down somewhere because it might not feel real. After everything — the Vucevic trade, the DeRozan trade, Coby White shipped to Utah — the youngest roster in the Eastern Conference walked into the United Center and beat Detroit 118-108.

And it wasn’t close.

They shot 63% from the field. 63% from three. Josh Giddey had 17 assists. Seventeen. That’s not a typo.

But the story is the kids.

Matas Buzelis scored 28. He moved like he’d been in the league five years. The jumper was falling, the handle was tight, and when Cade Cunningham tried to body him on a switch, Buzelis just rose up and hit the stepback anyway.

And then there’s Hank Trepagnier.

The rookie out of nowhere. Undrafted. Paulson found him in summer league footage and wouldn’t stop talking about his release. Tonight Trepagnier went 10-for-10 from the field. 5-for-5 from three. 26 points without missing a shot.

That doesn’t happen. That’s not a thing that happens.

The United Center was loud in a way it hasn’t been since the Butler years. Not playoff loud — confused loud. Happy confused. Like the building wasn’t sure if it was allowed to hope yet.

-----

## CHICAGO | Talia Finch — Ground Report

Benchmark Bar, West Loop. Game just ended.

Marcus — the optimist from last cycle — is buying rounds. “I told you,” he keeps saying. “I *told* you.”

DeShawn is already doing mock draft math on his phone, trying to figure out what happens to their pick positioning if they win 35 games. Janelle, the skeptic, is quiet. Not converted. But not arguing.

The TV behind the bar is showing Trepagnier highlights on loop. Some guy I don’t know yells “WHO IS THIS KID” and half the bar yells back.

One game. It’s one game. But the vibe in here is something I haven’t seen since I started covering this city. It’s not hope exactly. It’s… curiosity. Like everyone just realized they don’t know what’s going to happen next.

That might be the most valuable thing Paulson gave them.

OAKLAND TRIBUNE — CONTINUED

## EDITORIAL DESK | P Slayer
“The Two Cities of Mike Paulson”

Mike Paulson walked out of a press conference three cycles ago. That’s still true.

He made an unauthorized prediction about a health crisis affecting six Oakland neighborhoods. Dr. Patricia Nwosu publicly rebuked him within the hour. Sources described him as “devastated.” Ownership held an emergency call. Veterans privately questioned whether he planned to stay. That’s all still true.

And now his Chicago Bulls just won their season opener behind a 21-year-old forward and a rookie who shot 10-for-10, and Oakland’s front office just finalized the Travis Coles trade that might define the next half-decade of American League baseball.

How do you hold both of those things at once?

I don’t know if Oakland has forgiven the presser. I don’t know if Oakland should. A man running a baseball team during a public health emergency decided he knew better than the doctors, said so out loud, and then walked away when someone asked him to explain himself. That happened in this city, to this city.

But Benji Dillon is back. Travis Coles is in the rotation. Darrin Davis will presumably heal from his ACL sprain now that the practice facility fire is apparently under control. And Mike Paulson is somehow building a contender while also building whatever Chicago is becoming.

The Temescal schools reported an absence spike today. Level 2. That’s not related to Paulson. It’s not related to anything he controls. But this city is still living in the aftermath of what he said, and the health desk is still tracking clusters, and the fog this morning felt heavy in a way that made everyone move a little slower.

He’s going to have to come back here eventually. The A’s still play in Oakland. Spring training will end and there will be games and he will stand in that tunnel and this city will decide what it thinks of him.

I don’t think we’ve decided yet.

## CIVIC DESK | Luis Navarro

The fog didn’t lift until almost noon. By then, word had already spread through Temescal about the schools.

I walked the district this morning. Talked to people. Not officials — people.

Brianna Nguyen, 34, works receiving at a distribution center off 40th. She told me her shift supervisor mentioned the school absences before she’d even heard about it from the district. “Someone’s kid called in sick, then someone else’s, then everyone’s checking their phones. By 10 AM we’re all just standing there wondering if we’re supposed to go pick up our kids.”

She didn’t pick up her kid. “What am I supposed to do? I leave, I lose the shift. They’re not sending anyone home. The school didn’t call.”

That’s the thing about Level 2. It’s not a lockdown. It’s not a shelter-in-place. It’s a designation that exists in a spreadsheet somewhere while parents try to figure out what it means for their actual Tuesday.

The Downtown respiratory wave is still technically active — Level 1, which means “monitoring” — but nobody I talked to in Temescal even mentioned it. That crisis feels finished to them even if the health desk hasn’t closed the file.

This one feels different. Kids getting sick hits different.

## NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT | Temescal

Marcus Carter works security at a building on Telegraph. He’s been there three years. He told me the fog this morning felt “heavy in a way that gets in your head.”

“Everyone coming through the lobby was moving slow. Not just physically. Like they were thinking about something they didn’t want to talk about.”

I asked if he’d heard about the school absences.

“Not specifically. But you can feel when something’s off. People hold doors different. They don’t make eye contact the same way. I’ve worked this building through two crises now. You learn to read the lobby.”

The Temescal corridor has been quieter since the Downtown wave peaked. Foot traffic at the Street-Level Vendors Block is down. Bridge & Barrel reported a steady but subdued crowd last night — volume 4, but the vibe was “waiting,” according to the bartender.

The fog lifts. The numbers come in. The city adjusts. That’s what Oakland does.

But Marcus is right. You can feel when something’s off.

## HEALTH DESK | Dr. Lila Mezran — Follow-up

I got partial data from county health.

The Temescal school cluster is concentrated in three elementary schools within a six-block radius. Symptoms are consistent: fatigue, mild fever, some respiratory involvement but not severe. No hospitalizations. No confirmed pathogen yet.

The pattern looks like early-stage viral spread, but the clustering is unusual. These aren’t schools that share bus routes or after-school programs. The only obvious connection is geography.

The fog conditions this morning had a 1.3 impact rating — that’s high. Dense, persistent, low-visibility fog that holds particulates close to the ground. If there’s something environmental at play, this is the weather that would amplify it.

I’m not drawing conclusions. I’m noting that we’ve now had two Level 2 health events in consecutive cycle windows — different neighborhoods, different age demographics, different symptom profiles — during a period of sustained civic instability and harsh weather conditions.

The Downtown wave was adults in workplace settings. This is children in schools. If those two things connect, we need to know. If they don’t connect, we need to know that too.

County health is supposed to send full case distribution by end of day. I’ll update when I have it.

## SPORTS | Anthony Reyes — Practice Facility Fire, Continued

I made some calls about the fire.

It started in a storage area adjacent to the weight room. Electrical, according to preliminary assessment. The facility is old — built in 2019, retrofitted twice, never quite updated to handle the load the modern training operation puts on it.

Darrin Davis was in the rehab wing, which is on the opposite side of the building. He was never in danger. But here’s the thing: the rehab wing shares HVAC with the main facility. They evacuated everyone as a precaution because no one knew what was burning.

Davis has been rehabbing that ACL for six weeks now. He’s the reigning MVP. He led the league in home runs. He’s supposed to be the centerpiece of a championship run. And yesterday he was standing in a parking lot in sweats watching smoke come out of the building where he’s supposed to be getting healthy.

I talked to a source close to the team. “He didn’t say much. Just watched. You could tell he was thinking about everything.”

Everything meaning: the ACL, the lost playoff time, the new manager he’s never worked with, the roster overhaul happening around him, the GM who’s now running two teams in two cities.

The fire was minor. The damage was minor. But the image of Darrin Davis watching smoke rise from the practice facility — that’s going to stick.

## CULTURE | Evening Section

The Winter Riverfront Festival opened this weekend. Attendance was modest — the fog kept people home Saturday morning, and by the time it lifted, the day was half gone.

But by Sunday afternoon, the waterfront had filled in. Families with strollers. Couples in heavy coats. A few A’s jerseys visible in the crowd, which is notable given the offseason uncertainty.

I saw Evan Morello near the food vendors — the actor, local, been in a few things. He was with someone I didn’t recognize, eating something from a paper bowl, looking like everyone else. That’s the thing about Oakland celebrities. They’re around. They’re just… around.

The festival runs through next weekend. Weather permitting.

## COMMUNITY TEXTURE | Twilight Teahouse, Laurel

The Teahouse has been steady through all of this. Volume 4, vibe “steady,” movement “normal” — that’s what the numbers say. What the numbers don’t capture is the specific quality of conversation in a place like this during a week like this.

Colin Lee, 42, has been coming here for years. He told me he’s been having more conversations about “city stuff” than usual.

“Normally people talk about work, family, whatever. Lately it’s different. People want to process. The health thing, the fog, the GM situation — it all kind of blends together. You don’t talk about one thing. You talk about the feeling of all of it.”

I asked what the feeling was.

“Cautious. Not scared. Just… paying attention. Like the city is asking you to pay attention and you’re finally listening.”

The Teahouse is one of those places that holds the neighborhood’s mood. Laurel has had its own micro-event wave running for weeks — small things, repeated patterns, nothing dramatic but persistent. The pattern-wave flag has been active since Cycle 33.

When I left, the fog was starting to settle again. The evening crowd was arriving. Someone had put on music — something quiet, ambient, the kind of thing that fills space without demanding attention.

The city is paying attention. The city is always paying attention.

## CHICAGO SATELLITE | Marcello Reyes — League Context

The Bulls opener wasn’t just a win. It was a statement about what Paulson thinks basketball can be.

63% shooting. 38 assists on 44 made field goals. A rookie going 10-for-10. This wasn’t grinding out a victory — this was a system operating at full efficiency against a team that didn’t know how to stop it.

The league noticed.

I talked to a Western Conference scout who watched the game. “It looked like a scrimmage. Like they were running plays against air. Either Detroit was completely unprepared, or Chicago has something.”

The question is sustainability. You don’t shoot 63% over 82 games. You don’t go 5-for-5 from three as a rookie every night. The Bulls will regress to something more normal. The question is what “normal” looks like for a team built entirely on Paulson’s philosophy.

The Giannis rumors are still floating. Milwaukee sources say he’s untouchable. Chicago sources say the Bulls have called. The draft capital is there — they’re sitting on four first-rounders now, with more potential swaps. If Milwaukee stumbles early and Giannis gets frustrated, Paulson has the assets to make a move.

But that’s future speculation. Right now, the Bulls are 1-0, they play Orlando on Friday, and the United Center is buzzing for the first time in years.

## EDITORIAL DESK | Hal Richmond — Senior Historian
“The Practice of Waiting”

I’ve been covering Oakland sports for thirty-seven years. I’ve seen dynasties built and dismantled. I’ve seen championships and collapses. I’ve seen fires — literal and metaphorical.

What I’ve learned is that the waiting is the hardest part. Not the crisis. Not the victory. The waiting.

Right now, Oakland is waiting on a lot of things. Waiting to see if Darrin Davis heals. Waiting to see if Deacon Seymour can manage a clubhouse he’s never managed. Waiting to see if Travis Coles is as good as the price we paid for him. Waiting to see if Mike Paulson is still really ours.

The Temescal schools are waiting for test results. The Downtown corridor is waiting to see if the respiratory numbers actually stay down. The waterfront is waiting for the fog to lift so the festival can breathe.

Waiting is what cities do. We process in real time. We absorb information as it comes. We adjust.

Benji Dillon signed a one-year deal worth thirteen million dollars. That’s a bet on the present, not the future. He’s 38. He knows what this is. He’s not waiting — he’s choosing.

There’s something clarifying about that. About a man at the end of his career looking at a roster in flux and saying: I want to be here for this part.

The rest of us will keep waiting. But we’ll wait together. That’s what Oakland does.
