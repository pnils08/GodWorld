“Fruitvale’s October Rosary: When Mrs. Delgado Prays the Lineup”
Every playoff game, Rosa Delgado lights a candle for the starting pitcher.
She’s done this since 2031, when her grandson—ten years old then, studying for confirmation—asked her if God cared about baseball. She told him God cares about everything people care about, which means God definitely cares about baseball, especially in Oakland, especially in Fruitvale.
So she started praying the rosary during games. Not for wins, exactly. For safety. For health. For the players to do their best and come home whole.
This October, she lit candles for Henry Rivas (Game 1, ALCS), Arturo Ramos (Game 2), Benji Dillon (Game 4). She’s 73 now. Her grandson is 19, working at the corner store on International Boulevard, still watching every game.
“When Darrin got hurt the second time,” she told me over coffee at Tierra Mia, “I prayed a whole rosary just for his ankle. Not for him to play. Just for it to heal right. I don’t know if he comes back next year, but I know his ankle will heal because I prayed it.”
Mrs. Delgado doesn’t go to the Coliseum anymore—her knees, she says, tapping the table—but her daughter streams the games on a tablet in the kitchen. The candles line the windowsill: white votives in glass holders, one for each starter, labeled in marker with their names.
When the season ended, she blew them all out except one. Benji Dillon’s. That one she let burn down to nothing.
“He came back for us,” she said. “The least I could do was keep his light on until it finished.”
