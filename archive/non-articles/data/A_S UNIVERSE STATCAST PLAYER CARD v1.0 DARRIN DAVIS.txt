Cold Zones: High fastballs away
High/Low Effectiveness:
– CRUSHES low pitches

⸻

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Underlying xSLG confirms Davis’s power is REAL, not inflated.
• He sees the ball extremely well low in the zone — few hitters match his lift quality there.
• Whiff% is high but “productive;” he swings to do damage, not to survive.
• Injury flare-ups (like the ACL sprain) impact mobility, not bat speed.
• Projection: 30–40 HR seasons remain possible into early 30s.

⸻

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“He hits baseballs like he’s trying to erase the scoreboard.
Davis doesn’t do quiet production — he drops noise into stadiums.
He’ll chase bad pitches because he’s hunting EXTRA bases, not singles.
The dude is chaos you can count on.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Every dynasty has a force in the middle of the order — a hitter whose presence changes the temperature of innings.
Davis is that force for Oakland.
He hasn’t always been the star, but he has always been the storm.”
