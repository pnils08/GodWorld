JUNETEENTH DRAWS FORTY THOUSAND ACROSS OAKLAND

DeFremery celebration anchors citywide observance; attendance up 25% from last year

By Maria Keen | Cultural Liaison

WEST OAKLAND — The smoke started rising before dawn.

Terrell Davis had his grandson at the grill by six, teaching him the same mesquite technique his own grandmother taught him fifty years ago in this same park.

“She’d have me up before sunrise,” Davis said, adjusting the coals. “Said you can’t rush smoke. Now look at him” — he nodded toward the twelve-year-old tending the fire — “didn’t even have to wake him.”

By noon, DeFremery Park was packed. Gospel choirs opened the main stage at twelve. Hip-hop closed it past midnight. Between them, Oakland celebrated.

Community Director Hayes coordinated programming across four districts — West Oakland’s main stage, Downtown rooftop mixers, Fruitvale family gatherings, Lake Merritt’s evening fireworks. The city estimate put total attendance at roughly forty thousand, up from thirty-two thousand last year.

Elena Patel, 31, brought her two kids from West Oakland. They’d never been to Juneteenth before.

“We moved here last year,” Patel said, watching the crowd fill the lawn. “I didn’t know Oakland did this. It feels like the whole city showed up.”

Mayor Avery Santana spoke briefly at the West Oakland stage, keeping remarks focused on the holiday rather than city business.

“Today we remember,” Santana said. “Tomorrow we get back to work.”

The work resumes next cycle, when the Stabilization Fund — $28 million for West Oakland anti-displacement programs — moves to committee hearing. But for one weekend, the neighborhood chose to celebrate what it still has.

STABILIZATION FUND HEADS TO COMMITTEE NEXT CYCLE

Carter counting votes; six needed, four confirmed

By Carmen Delaine | Bay Tribune Civic Affairs

The West Oakland Stabilization Fund moves to committee hearing next cycle with the same math that’s defined the debate from the start: six votes to pass, four confirmed, two needed.

Councilwoman Denise Carter has been working the phones since her confirmation. The $28 million reserve draw would fund anti-displacement programs, tenant legal services, and down-payment assistance for longtime West Oakland residents.

“The numbers are the numbers,” Carter said. “We need six. We’re working to get six.”

Javier Harris, 57, an electrician who’s lived in West Oakland for thirty years, plans to testify at the Cycle 77 hearing.

“I watched three families on my block pack trucks this year,” Harris said. “The fund won’t bring them back. But it might keep the rest of us here.”

The progressive bloc — Carter, Rose Delgado, Janae Rivers, and Terrence Mobley — gives the fund four reliable votes. Council President Ramon Vega has signaled support in principle. Leonard Tran remains genuinely undecided.

The CRC caucus presents the steepest climb. Warren Ashford has been openly skeptical. Nina Chen wants fiscal projections. Elliott Crane, participating remotely, has not indicated his position.

TEMESCAL READINGS STABLE; HEALTH CENTER VOTE ON TRACK FOR CYCLE 80

Indicators elevated but holding as council prepares appropriation decision

By Dr. Lila Mezran | Health Desk

TEMESCAL — Three cycles after elevated illness indicators first triggered concern, the neighborhood’s health metrics have stabilized at levels above baseline but below peak readings.

Andre Lee, 55, an electrician who lives three blocks from the proposed Health Center site, said the wait times at local clinics have improved but remain frustrating.

“Last month my wife waited four hours for a twenty-minute appointment,” Lee said. “The staff isn’t slow — they’re overwhelmed. We need that building.”

The proposed Temescal Community Health Center — $48 million total, with $18 million requiring Council appropriation — remains on track for its Cycle 80 vote. That vote requires a simple majority (5-4), making it significantly easier to pass than the Stabilization Fund’s supermajority requirement.

Councilman Warren Ashford, whose District 7 includes Temescal, has not committed to supporting the appropriation despite the facility’s location in his district.

“I support healthcare,” Ashford said. “I have questions about timing.”

ROCKRIDGE CAFÉ STAFF WALKS OUT OVER SCHEDULING

Second labor action in neighborhood’s restaurant scene this year

By Jordan Velez | Economics & Labor

ROCKRIDGE — The Saturday morning line that usually stretches down College Avenue wasn’t there. The café was dark.

Staff at a popular Rockridge brunch destination walked out Friday, citing erratic scheduling and last-minute shift changes. Approximately eight workers — servers, kitchen staff, and a barista — left together.

Howard Young, 56, a barista who participated in the walkout, said the final straw came when management posted a new schedule with his hours cut from thirty to twelve without explanation.

“We asked for a meeting,” Young said. “We got a schedule change instead.”

The owner, reached by phone, said the closure was temporary. “We’re working through some internal issues. We value our team.”

The walkout is the second labor action in Rockridge’s restaurant scene this year, following a brief strike at a pizza establishment in Cycle 62.

FOOD POISONING COMPLAINT UNDER INVESTIGATION

Single report from Juneteenth vendor; no pattern identified

By Sgt. Rachel Torres | Public Safety

WEST OAKLAND — Alameda County health officials are investigating a food poisoning complaint filed by a West Oakland resident following a Juneteenth event.

The complaint alleges that food purchased from a vendor at DeFremery Park caused gastrointestinal symptoms in the complainant and two family members. No hospitalizations were reported.

The vendor — a permitted operation with no prior violations — cooperated with inspection. Health department officials noted that outdoor conditions can create food safety challenges that don’t necessarily indicate negligence.

“This is a single complaint,” a health department spokesperson said. “We take all reports seriously, but there’s no indication of a broader pattern.”

KEANE SPOTTED IN ROCKRIDGE AS DYNASTY REUNION PLANS TAKE SHAPE

Organization reaching out to championship-era players for farewell season tribute events

By Hal Richmond | Senior Historian

ROCKRIDGE — Vinnie Keane was at La Farine on College Avenue last Tuesday, sharing a table with his wife Amara, a pot of coffee between them, neither one in any hurry.

A fan approached. Keane signed a napkin. The fan left. Keane went back to his croissant.

This is what thirty-six looks like when you’ve won six championships. This is what retirement speculation looks like when you’ve decided to come back for one more year.

The organization confirmed this week that it has begun reaching out to players from the dynasty era to participate in tribute events throughout Keane’s final season. The heroes of those years — Keane, Dillon, Kelley, Davis, Aitken — drifted into legend gradually. Now the franchise is planning to bring that history back for one last victory lap.

“Vinnie built this,” one front office source said. “The guys who built it with him deserve to be here when he says goodbye.”

Spring training opens soon. The dynasty’s final chapter starts after that.

DILLON’S SECOND SCIENCE MONTHLY COVER: “THE ARM IS TEMPORARY. CLEAN WATER ISN’T.”

Pitcher’s off-season work in water filtration technology gets international recognition

By Anthony | A’s Beat

OAKLAND — Most pitchers spend the off-season working on their mechanics. Benji Dillon spent it working on water.

The 38-year-old left-hander appears on the cover of Science Monthly for the second time — the first for his data-driven approach to pitching, this time for his ongoing work in water filtration technology in developing regions.

“Find the seam. Find the problem. Fix the problem,” Dillon said when reached for comment. “The arm is temporary. Clean water isn’t.”

Dillon’s involvement in filtration technology dates back to the dynasty years, when he began funding research through his charitable foundation. The Science Monthly feature details a low-cost membrane system his team developed that has been deployed in three countries.

He returns to the A’s rotation this season on a one-year, $13 million deal — back in green and gold after a winter of uncertainty. The anticipated 2041 rotation: Rivas, Ramos, Coles, Ellis, Dillon.

Xavier Garcia, 47, a Jack London office worker who grew up watching Dillon pitch, said the Science Monthly cover matters more than any game stat.

“He won us championships,” Garcia said. “Now he’s saving lives. That’s what Oakland players do.”

GIDDEY’S 23 ASSISTS ONE SHY OF FRANCHISE RECORD AS BULLS DEMOLISH LAKERS

Stanley’s crossover on Dončić highlights Chicago’s Eastern Conference dominance

By Selena Grant | Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — Josh Giddey needed one more.

The Bulls point guard finished with 23 assists in Chicago’s 132-120 destruction of the Lakers on Sunday — one assist shy of Guy Rodgers’ franchise record of 24, set in 1966.

“I didn’t know until the fourth quarter,” Giddey said afterward. “Someone on the bench told me. Then I started looking for everyone.”

He found them. Hank Trepagnier finished with 30 points and 8 rebounds. Walker Kessler added 25 and 10. Adash Stanley — the 19-year-old from Poland who wasn’t supposed to be here — scored 26 with 5 assists, including a third-quarter sequence that stopped the United Center cold.

Stanley caught the ball at the top of the key, crossed over Luka Dončić, drove baseline, and threw down a dunk that had the crowd on its feet for thirty seconds.

“He’s fearless,” Giddey said of Stanley. “Doesn’t matter who’s guarding him.”

The win pushed Chicago to 33-14, best in the Eastern Conference.

THE KID FROM KRAKÓW: ADASH STANLEY’S UNLIKELY PATH TO THE UNITED CENTER

Undrafted, overlooked, unstoppable

By Talia Finch | Chicago Ground

CHICAGO — Adash Stanley wasn’t supposed to be here.

Not on an NBA roster. Not crossing over Luka Dončić. Not finishing with 26 points on a Sunday afternoon while 20,000 people screamed his name.

The 19-year-old from Kraków, Poland went undrafted. Every team passed. Mike Paulson didn’t.

“I saw the hustle rating,” Paulson said after acquiring Stanley from the G League in October. “Ninety-nine. You can’t teach that.”

Stanley stands 6’2”, 180 pounds. He’s not the biggest point guard, not the fastest, not the most skilled. But he plays every possession like it’s his last.

“In Poland, basketball is not the first sport,” Stanley said through an interpreter when he first arrived. “Football. Hockey. Then maybe basketball. I had to fight for everything.”

He’s still fighting. Teammates say he’s “Laid Back” off the court — reading Polish literature, exploring Chicago’s Eastern European restaurants. On the court, he transforms.

“He’s got A potential,” one Bulls scout said. “The question was always whether he’d get the chance to show it.”

He’s showing it.

PAULSON BREAKS SILENCE: “MY IMMEDIATE PLANS ARE WITH CHICAGO”

Statement leaves door open for Warriors; no long-term commitment mentioned

By Selena Grant | Chicago Bureau

Mike Paulson finally addressed the question everyone’s been asking.

The dual-franchise GM posted a brief statement to social media Sunday evening: “My immediate plans are to be with the Bulls this season. There is no long-term agreement in Chicago.”

The statement answers the question while raising several more. Paulson’s commitment is temporal, not permanent. The door to Oakland remains open.

The Warriors, now 25-22 after a hot streak that coincided with the Paulson rumors, have reportedly made their interest known. Golden State’s ownership views the two-time GM of the Year — six World Series titles with the A’s, immediate turnaround in Chicago — as the executive who could bridge the Curry era to whatever comes next.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
############################################################

**“The Stabilization Fund needs action, not analysis”**

Everyone’s talking about the Health Center (five votes) and Baylight (five votes). Nobody’s talking about the Stabilization Fund.

West Oakland needs that money. We need displacement prevention. We need tenant protections. The fund has been sitting there waiting for a council that could vote. Now we have one.

I watched my neighbors pack trucks last month. I’m not waiting for another study.

— Colin Phillips, 30, Laurel, Bakery Worker

**“Juneteenth meant something different this year”**

My grandmother came to Oakland in 1958. She’d never seen a Juneteenth celebration before she got here. This year I took my granddaughter to DeFremery. Four generations celebrating in the same city.

The news talks about migration and population. What they don’t talk about is what it means when your family can stay somewhere long enough to build traditions.

— Devon Green, 60, Downtown, Delivery Driver

-----

**“Ashford should support the Health Center in his own district”**

Warren Ashford represents Temescal. The Health Center would be built in Temescal. His constituents need healthcare.

His concerns about “timing” sound like concerns about spending money on people who need it.
