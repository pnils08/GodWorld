EDITORIAL GUIDANCE — MEDIA ROOM
Cycle 77 Coverage Priorities
Two items require directed coverage this cycle. Standard packet signals (Father’s Day, sports, weather, background threads) proceed as normal.

WEST OAKLAND STABILIZATION FUND — COMMITTEE HEARING
The committee hearing occurs this cycle. Floor vote follows Cycle 78.
Coverage should include:
	∙	Hearing proceedings and any testimony
	∙	Javier Harris (57, West Oakland, Electrician) is expected to testify — he was quoted in Cycle 75-76 on landlord grant enforcement and plans to speak
	∙	Watch for position shifts among council members, particularly the swing votes
	∙	Marcus Wright (29, West Oakland, Server) expressed skepticism in Cycle 75 — callback opportunity if resident reaction is needed
Current count heading into hearing:
	∙	4 YES: Carter (D1), Delgado (D3), Rivers (D5), Mobley (D9)
	∙	1 Lean YES: Vega (D4)
	∙	1 Undecided: Tran (D2)
	∙	2 Lean NO: Ashford (D7), Chen (D8)
	∙	1 Unknown: Crane (D6, remote)
The fund requires 6-3 for passage. OPP bloc has 4. They need both independents or one independent plus Crane.

OARI — PRESSURE CAMPAIGN BEGINS
Vincent Ramirez (OPOA President) announced a campaign targeting Ramon Vega’s district (D4 — Adams Point) last cycle. This cycle marks the beginning of that pressure.
Coverage should include:
	∙	Any OPOA activity in District 4 (mailers, town hall scheduling, public statements)
	∙	Ramirez as opposition voice — he called OARI “defunding by another name”
	∙	Vega’s position remains undecided — he faces pressure from both OPOA and progressive coalition
This is background political maneuvering, not front-page. The OARI vote is not until Cycle 82. But the pressure campaign is now active and should register in coverage.

All other cycle signals proceed through normal editorial judgment.
