PITCH-TYPE PERFORMANCE

Crushes:
• Sliders
• Curveballs
• Splitters

This is a MAJOR part of his identity — he is a spin destroyer.

⸻

SIM-BASED DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY

Major attribute spikes:
+7 Contact vs R
+7 Vision
+7 Clutch

This indicates rapid learning curve, especially mentally.

Projection Path:
• Floor: Fourth outfielder with defense + speed
• Median: Everyday LF/CF with 30+ doubles
• Ceiling: Lead-off menace if LA & EV improve

ETA: Late 2041
Rule 5 eligible → risk of being taken if not protected.

⸻

NOTES (ANTHONY — ANALYTICS)

• Elite speed + emerging contact profile makes him one of the most projectable young OFs in the org.
• Needs meaningful work on top-of-zone fastball recognition.
• Defensive projection is extraordinarily strong — could anchor CF if bat matures.
• Contact gains are NOT noise — development team notes confirm mechanical stability.
• Rule 5 danger: Oakland must consider early protection.

⸻

NOTES (P SLAYER — EMOTIONAL TAKE)

“Morton runs like he’s mad at the ground.
You can see him decide he’s taking third — and then he’s just there.
If his bat wakes up even halfway, someone’s losing their job next year.”

⸻

NOTES (HAL RICHMOND — HISTORICAL)

“Oakland has long cherished outfielders who move with purpose — Crisp, Davis, Kelley before the shift.
Morton belongs to that lineage: a player whose legs write the rhythm of innings.”
